Information for people packaging the Guest Additions for Linux distributions
============================================================================
We strongly recommend that people packaging the Guest Additions for Linux
distributions track the latest stable version rather than staying with a given
major release number for the life-time of the distribution.  The major number
is more relevant for the host software (the actual VirtualBox application)
than for the Linux Additions, which are developed more continuously.

We sometimes have two stable versions at one time - one with more features and
a long-term stable version from the previous major release, which has less
features but a code base which has had longer to mature.  While this is also
less relevant for the Additions, you can find the current long-term stable
release version number at
