#   1: The input DITA file (output from docbook-refentry-to-manual-dita.xsl).
#   2: dita-refentry-flat-topic-ids.xsl
#   3: dita-refentry-flat-to-single-topic.xsl
#   4: The refentry.kmk file where the DITA file list will be appended.
#   5: Variable name to update in refentry.kmk.
#   6: The out directory.
#   7: '--'
#   8+: xsltproc invocation (sans output, input and xslt file).
