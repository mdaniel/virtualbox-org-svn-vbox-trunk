    <para>
      Welcome to the <emphasis role="strong">VirtualBox Accessibility Support</emphasis> documentation! This document is primarily
      a reference to help people who are interested in our project accessibility support and will describe how to use VirtualBox
      user interface step-by-step. Since whole the application navigation will be explained here, this document will also be
      helpful for those who are not familiar with our product user interface and wish to learn more. It will be written in a bit
      excessive manner so that many obvious things will be explained too precicely to make it easier to understand by ear for a
      blind users. The document will be periodically updated with recent changes and test-cases allowing us to more strictly
      follow the required guidelines and make our product fully accessible.
    </para>
    <para>
      Our application is based on Qt5, a powerful cross-platform library which allows to visualize various user interface ideas
      the most flexible and native way. This also means that the library we use is responsible for many navigation and
      accessibility aspects (like fonts, size hints, colors, look&amp;feel patterns and many other things), but not for all of
      them. Nativity as one of the main ideas of the Qt-based application sometimes brings additional complexity because there is
      always at least one host which uses unique combination of fonts and colors which breaks accessibility support in an
      unpredictable way.
    </para>
    <para>
      Independently on platform we are supporting screen-reader applications which can communicate with Qt5 accessibility
      interface which supports Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), OS X Accessibility, and the Unix/X11 AT-SPI standard.

    <para>
      Our application user interface is able to be started in two modes:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            First of them is <emphasis role="strong">VirtualBox Manager</emphasis> user interface, the main application window
            which allows to manage and configure virtual machines and their groups. Besides that, this window provides user with
            access to various global and machine related tools allowing to administrate some of VirtualBox objects and their
            settings.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Second application mode is <emphasis role="strong">Virtual Machine</emphasis> user interface, which allows to control
            virtual machine guest screens as separate application windows. Besides that, this interface allows to access some of
            machine tools and adjust guest screens up to your needs, by changing their resolution and toggling full-screen,
            seamless and scaled modes.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      But first of all we should start from the <emphasis role="strong">General Concept</emphasis> which is related to whole the
      GUI and summarizes the navigation and accessibility aspects we are using for whole application.
