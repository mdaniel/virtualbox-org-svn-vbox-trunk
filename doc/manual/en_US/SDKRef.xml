    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>VirtualBox comes with comprehensive support for third-party
    developers. This Software Development Kit (SDK) contains all the
    documentation and interface files that are needed to write code that
    interacts with VirtualBox.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Modularity: the building blocks of VirtualBox</title>

      <para>VirtualBox is cleanly separated into several layers, which can be
      visualized like in the picture below:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/vbox-components.png"
                     width="12cm"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The orange area represents code that runs in kernel mode, the blue
      area represents userspace code.</para>

      <para>At the bottom of the stack resides the hypervisor -- the core of
      the virtualization engine, controlling execution of the virtual machines
      and making sure they do not conflict with each other or whatever the
      host computer is doing otherwise.</para>

      <para>On top of the hypervisor, additional internal modules provide
      extra functionality. For example, the RDP server, which can deliver the
      graphical output of a VM remotely to an RDP client, is a separate module
      that is only loosely tacked into the virtual graphics device. Live
      Migration and Resource Monitor are additional modules currently in the
      process of being added to VirtualBox.</para>

      <para>What is primarily of interest for purposes of the SDK is the API
      layer block that sits on top of all the previously mentioned blocks.
      This API, which we call the <emphasis role="bold">"Main API"</emphasis>,
      exposes the entire feature set of the virtualization engine below. It is
      completely documented in this SDK Reference -- see <xref
      linkend="sdkref_classes"/> and <xref linkend="sdkref_enums"/> -- and
      available to anyone who wishes to control VirtualBox programmatically.
      We chose the name "Main API" to differentiate it from other programming
      interfaces of VirtualBox that may be publicly accessible.</para>

      <para>With the Main API, you can create, configure, start, stop and
      delete virtual machines, retrieve performance statistics about running
      VMs, configure the VirtualBox installation in general, and more. In
      fact, internally, the front-end programs
      <computeroutput>VirtualBox</computeroutput> and
      <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> use nothing but this API as
      well -- there are no hidden backdoors into the virtualization engine for
      our own front-ends. This ensures the entire Main API is both
      well-documented and well-tested. (The same applies to
      <computeroutput>VBoxHeadless</computeroutput>, which is not shown in the
      image.)</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="webservice-or-com">
      <title>Two guises of the same "Main API": the web service or
      COM/XPCOM</title>

      <para>There are several ways in which the Main API can be called by
      other code:<orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>VirtualBox comes with a <emphasis role="bold">web
            service</emphasis> that maps nearly the entire Main API. The web
            service ships in a stand-alone executable
            (<computeroutput>vboxwebsrv</computeroutput>) that, when running,
            acts as an HTTP server, accepts SOAP connections and processes
            them.</para>

            <para>Since the entire web service API is publicly described in a
            web service description file (in WSDL format), you can write
            client programs that call the web service in any language with a
            toolkit that understands WSDL. These days, that includes most
            programming languages that are available: Java, C++, .NET, PHP,
            Python, Perl and probably many more.</para>

            <para>All of this is explained in detail in subsequent chapters of
            this book.</para>

            <para>There are two ways in which you can write client code that
            uses the web service:<orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>For Java as well as Python, the SDK contains
                  easy-to-use classes that allow you to use the web service in
                  an object-oriented, straightforward manner. We shall refer
                  to this as the <emphasis role="bold">"object-oriented web
                  service (OOWS)"</emphasis>.</para>

                  <para>The OO bindings for Java are described in <xref
                  linkend="javaapi"/>, those for Python in <xref
                  linkend="glue-python-ws"/>.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Alternatively, you can use the web service directly,
                  without the object-oriented client layer. We shall refer to
                  this as the <emphasis role="bold">"raw web
                  service"</emphasis>.</para>

                  <para>You will then have neither native object orientation
                  nor full type safety, since web services are neither
                  object-oriented nor stateful. However, in this way, you can
                  write client code even in languages for which we do not ship
                  object-oriented client code; all you need is a programming
                  language with a toolkit that can parse WSDL and generate
                  client wrapper code from it.</para>

                  <para>We describe this further in <xref
                  linkend="raw-webservice"/>, with samples for Java and
                  Perl.</para>
                </listitem>
              </orderedlist></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Internally, for portability and easier maintenance, the Main
            API is implemented using the <emphasis role="bold">Component
            Object Model (COM), </emphasis> an interprocess mechanism for
            software components originally introduced by Microsoft for
            Microsoft Windows. On a Windows host, VirtualBox will use
            Microsoft COM; on other hosts where COM is not present, it ships
            with XPCOM, a free software implementation of COM originally
            created by the Mozilla project for their browsers.</para>

            <para>So, if you are familiar with COM and the C++ programming
            language (or with any other programming language that can handle
            COM/XPCOM objects, such as Java, Visual Basic or C#), then you can
            use the COM/XPCOM API directly. VirtualBox comes with all
            necessary files and documentation to build fully functional COM
            applications. For an introduction, please see <xref
            linkend="api_com"/> below.</para>

            <para>The VirtualBox front-ends (the graphical user interfaces as
            well as the command line), which are all written in C++, use
            COM/XPCOM to call the Main API. Technically, the web service is
            another front-end to this COM API, mapping almost all of it to
            SOAP clients.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist></para>

      <para>If you wonder which way to choose, here are a few
      comparisons:<table>

      <para>In the following chapters, we will describe the different ways in
      which to program VirtualBox, starting with the method that is easiest to
      use and then increase complexity as we go along.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="api_soap_intro">
      <title>About web services in general</title>

      <para>Web services are a particular type of programming interface.
      Whereas, with "normal" programming, a program calls an application
      programming interface (API) defined by another program or the operating
      system and both sides of the interface have to agree on the calling
      convention and, in most cases, use the same programming language, web
      services use Internet standards such as HTTP and XML to
      communicate.<footnote>
          <para>In some ways, web services promise to deliver the same thing
          as CORBA and DCOM did years ago. However, while these previous
          technologies relied on specific binary protocols and thus proved to
          be difficult to use between diverging platforms, web services
          circumvent these incompatibilities by using text-only standards like
          HTTP and XML. On the downside (and, one could say, typical of things
          related to XML), a lot of standards are involved before a web
          service can be implemented. Many of the standards invented around
          XML are used one way or another. As a result, web services are slow
          and verbose, and the details can be incredibly messy. The relevant
          standards here are called SOAP and WSDL, where SOAP describes the
          format of the messages that are exchanged (an XML document wrapped
          in an HTTP header), and WSDL is an XML format that describes a
          complete API provided by a web service. WSDL in turn uses XML Schema
          to describe types, which is not exactly terse either. However, as
          you will see from the samples provided in this chapter, the
          VirtualBox web service shields you from these details and is easy to
          use.</para>
        </footnote></para>

      <para>In order to successfully use a web service, a number of things are
      required -- primarily, a web service accepting connections; service
      descriptions; and then a client that connects to that web service. The
      connections are governed by the SOAP standard, which describes how
      messages are to be exchanged between a service and its clients; the
      service descriptions are governed by WSDL.</para>

      <para>In the case of VirtualBox, this translates into the following
      three components:<orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The VirtualBox web service (the "server"): this is the
            <computeroutput>vboxwebsrv</computeroutput> executable shipped
            with VirtualBox. Once you start this executable (which acts as a
            HTTP server on a specific TCP/IP port), clients can connect to the
            web service and thus control a VirtualBox installation.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>VirtualBox also comes with WSDL files that describe the
            services provided by the web service. You can find these files in
            the <computeroutput>sdk/bindings/webservice/</computeroutput>
            directory. These files are understood by the web service toolkits
            that are shipped with most programming languages and enable you to
            easily access a web service even if you don't use our
            object-oriented client layers. VirtualBox is shipped with
            pregenerated web service glue code for several languages (Python,
            Perl, Java).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A client that connects to the web service in order to
            control the VirtualBox installation.</para>

            <para>Unless you play with some of the samples shipped with
            VirtualBox, this needs to be written by you.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist></para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="runvboxwebsrv">
      <title>Running the web service</title>

      <para>The web service ships in an stand-alone executable,
      <computeroutput>vboxwebsrv</computeroutput>, that, when running, acts as
      a HTTP server, accepts SOAP connections and processes them -- remotely
      or from the same machine.<note>
          <para>The web service executable is not contained with the
          VirtualBox SDK, but instead ships with the standard VirtualBox
          binary package for your specific platform. Since the SDK contains
          only platform-independent text files and documentation, the binaries
          are instead shipped with the platform-specific packages. For this
          reason the information how to run it as a service is included in the
          VirtualBox documentation.</para>
        </note></para>

      <para>The <computeroutput>vboxwebsrv</computeroutput> program, which
      implements the web service, is a text-mode (console) program which,
      after being started, simply runs until it is interrupted with Ctrl-C or
      a kill command.</para>

      <para>Once the web service is started, it acts as a front-end to the
      VirtualBox installation of the user account that it is running under. In
      other words, if the web service is run under the user account of
      <computeroutput>user1</computeroutput>, it will see and manipulate the
      virtual machines and other data represented by the VirtualBox data of
      that user (for example, on a Linux machine, under
      <computeroutput>/home/user1/.config/VirtualBox</computeroutput>; see the
      VirtualBox User Manual for details on where this data is stored).</para>

      <sect2 id="vboxwebsrv-ref">
        <title>Command line options of vboxwebsrv</title>

            or an empty string is specified this is interpreted as an empty
            password (i.e. the private key is not protected by a password). If
            the file name <computeroutput>-</computeroutput> is specified then
            then the password is read from the standard input stream, otherwise

            service client that has logged on but makes no calls to the web
            service will automatically be disconnected after the number of
            seconds specified here, as if it had called the
            <computeroutput>IWebSessionManager::logoff()</computeroutput>
            method provided by the web service itself.</para>

            <para>It is normally vital that each web service client call this
            method, as the web service can accumulate large amounts of memory
            when running, especially if a web service client does not properly
            release managed object references. As a result, this timeout value
            should not be set too high, especially on machines with a high
            load on the web service, or the web service may eventually deny

            in which the web service checks for timed-out clients, in seconds,
            and defaults to 5. This normally does not need to be
            changed.</para>

            authentication method, otherwise it is set to the specified value.
            Using this parameter is a good measure against accidental

        <title>Authenticating at web service logon</title>

        <para>As opposed to the COM/XPCOM variant of the Main API, a client
        that wants to use the web service must first log on by calling the
        <link linkend="IWebsessionManager__logon">IWebsessionManager::logon()</link>
        API that is specific to the
        web service. Logon is necessary for the web service to be stateful;
        internally, it maintains a session for each client that connects to
        it.</para>

        <para>The <computeroutput>IWebsessionManager::logon()</computeroutput>
        API takes a user name and a password as arguments, which the web
        service then passes to a customizable authentication plugin that
        performs the actual authentication.</para>

        <para>For testing purposes, it is recommended that you first disable
        authentication with this command:
        <screen>VBoxManage setproperty websrvauthlibrary null</screen></para>

        <para><warning>
            <para>This will cause all logons to succeed, regardless of user
            name or password. This should of course not be used in a
            production environment.</para>
          </warning>Generally, the mechanism by which clients are
        authenticated is configurable by way of the
        <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> command:</para>

        <para><screen>VBoxManage setproperty websrvauthlibrary default|null|&lt;library&gt;</screen></para>

        <para>This way you can specify any shared object/dynamic link module
        that conforms with the specifications for VirtualBox external
        authentication modules as laid out in section <emphasis
        role="bold">VRDE authentication</emphasis> of the VirtualBox User
        Manual; the web service uses the same kind of modules as the
        VirtualBox VRDE server. For technical details on VirtualBox external
        authentication modules see <xref linkend="vbox-auth"/></para>

        <para>By default, after installation, the web service uses the
        VBoxAuth module that ships with VirtualBox. This module uses PAM on
        Linux hosts to authenticate users. Any valid username/password
        combination is accepted, it does not have to be the username and
        password of the user running the web service daemon. Unless
        <computeroutput>vboxwebsrv</computeroutput> runs as root, PAM
        authentication can fail, because sometimes the file
        <computeroutput>/etc/shadow</computeroutput>, which is used by PAM, is
        not readable. On most Linux distribution PAM uses a suid root helper
        internally, so make sure you test this before deploying it. One can
        override this behavior by setting the environment variable
        <computeroutput>VBOX_PAM_ALLOW_INACTIVE</computeroutput> which will
        suppress failures when unable to read the shadow password file. Please
        use this variable carefully, and only if you fully understand what
        you're doing.</para>

    <title>Environment-specific notes</title>

    <para>The Main API described in <xref linkend="sdkref_classes"/> and
    <xref linkend="sdkref_enums"/> is mostly identical in all the supported
    programming environments which have been briefly mentioned in the
    introduction of this book. As a result, the Main API's general concepts
    described in <xref linkend="concepts"/> are the same whether you use the
    object-oriented web service (OOWS) for JAX-WS or a raw web service
    connection via, say, Perl, or whether you use C++ COM bindings.</para>

    <para>Some things are different depending on your environment, however.
    These differences are explained in this chapter.</para>

    <sect1 id="glue">
      <title>Using the object-oriented web service (OOWS)</title>

      <para>As explained in <xref linkend="webservice-or-com"/>, VirtualBox
      ships with client-side libraries for Java, Python and PHP that allow you
      to use the VirtualBox web service in an intuitive, object-oriented way.
      These libraries shield you from the client-side complications of managed
      object references and other implementation details that come with the
      VirtualBox web service. (If you are interested in these complications,
      have a look at <xref linkend="raw-webservice"/>).</para>

      <para>We recommend that you start your experiments with the VirtualBox
      web service by using our object-oriented client libraries for JAX-WS, a
      web service toolkit for Java, which enables you to write code to
      interact with VirtualBox in the simplest manner possible.</para>

      <para>As "interfaces", "attributes" and "methods" are COM concepts,
      please read the documentation in <xref linkend="sdkref_classes"/> and
      <xref linkend="sdkref_enums"/> with the following notes in mind.</para>

      <para>The OOWS bindings attempt to map the Main API as closely as
      possible to the Java, Python and PHP languages. In other words, objects
      are objects, interfaces become classes, and you can call methods on
      objects as you would on local objects.</para>

      <para>The main difference remains with attributes: to read an attribute,
      call a "getXXX" method, with "XXX" being the attribute name with a
      capitalized first letter. So when the Main API Reference says that
      <computeroutput>IMachine</computeroutput> has a "name" attribute (see
      <link linkend="IMachine__name">IMachine::name</link>), call
      <computeroutput>getName()</computeroutput> on an IMachine object to
      obtain a machine's name. Unless the attribute is marked as read-only in
      the documentation, there will also be a corresponding "set"
      method.</para>

      <sect2 id="glue-jax-ws">
        <title>The object-oriented web service for JAX-WS</title>

        <para>JAX-WS is a powerful toolkit by Sun Microsystems to build both
        server and client code with Java. It is part of Java 6 (JDK 1.6), but
        can also be obtained separately for Java 5 (JDK 1.5). The VirtualBox
        SDK comes with precompiled OOWS bindings working with both Java 5 and
        6.</para>

        <para>The following sections explain how to get the JAX-WS sample code
        running and explain a few common practices when using the JAX-WS
        object-oriented web service.</para>

        <sect3>
          <title>Preparations</title>

          <para>Since JAX-WS is already integrated into Java 6, no additional
          preparations are needed for Java 6.</para>

          <para>If you are using Java 5 (JDK 1.5.x), you will first need to
          download and install an external JAX-WS implementation, as Java 5
          does not support JAX-WS out of the box; for example, you can
          download one from here: <ulink

          <title>Logging on to the web service</title>

          <para>Before a web service client can do anything useful, two

          <computeroutput>clienttest</computeroutput> constructor:<orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>An instance of

                which is an interface provided by the web service to manage
                "web sessions" -- that is, stateful connections to the web
                service with persistent objects upon which methods can be
                invoked.</para>

                <para>In the OOWS for JAX-WS, the IWebsessionManager class
                must be constructed explicitly, and a URL must be provided in
                the constructor that specifies where the web service (the

              <listitem>
                <para>After that, the code calls
                <link linkend="IWebsessionManager__logon">IWebsessionManager::logon()</link>,
                which is the first call that actually communicates with the
                server. This authenticates the client with the web service and
                returns an instance of
                <link linkend="IVirtualBox">IVirtualBox</link>,
                the most fundamental interface of the VirtualBox web service,

          <para>The current OOWS for JAX-WS has certain memory management

          <link linkend="IManagedObjectRef__release">IManagedObjectRef::release()</link>
          method explicitly, which
          frees appropriate managed reference, as is required by the raw
          web service; see <xref linkend="managed-object-references"/> for

        <title>The object-oriented web service for Python</title>

        <para>VirtualBox comes with two flavors of a Python API: one for web
        service, discussed here, and one for the COM/XPCOM API discussed in
        <xref linkend="pycom"/>. The client code is mostly similar, except
        for the initialization part, so it is up to the application developer
        to choose the appropriate technology. Moreover, a common Python glue
        layer exists, abstracting out concrete platform access details, see
        <xref linkend="glue-python"/>.</para>

        <para>The minimum supported Python version is 2.6.</para>

        <para>As indicated in <xref linkend="webservice-or-com"/>, the
        COM/XPCOM API gives better performance without the SOAP overhead, and
        does not require a web server to be running. On the other hand, the
        COM/XPCOM Python API requires a suitable Python bridge for your Python
        installation (VirtualBox ships the most important ones for each
        platform<footnote>
            <para>On On Mac OS X only the Python versions bundled with the OS

          than 2.16 are known to have bugs, leading to issues with VirtualBox
          Python bindings, so please make sure to use latest available Python
          and Win32 extensions.</para>

        <para>The VirtualBox OOWS for Python relies on the Python ZSI SOAP
        implementation (see <ulink
        url="http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/zsi.html">http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/zsi.html</ulink>),
        which you will need to install locally before trying the examples.
        Most Linux distributions come with package for ZSI, such as
        <computeroutput>python-zsi</computeroutput> in Ubuntu.</para>

        <para>To get started, open a terminal and change to the
        <computeroutput>bindings/glue/python/sample</computeroutput>
        directory, which contains an example of a simple interactive shell
        able to control a VirtualBox instance. The shell is written using the
        API layer, thereby hiding different implementation details, so it is
        actually an example of code share among XPCOM, MSCOM and web services.
        If you are interested in how to interact with the web services layer
        directly, have a look at
        <computeroutput>install/vboxapi/__init__.py</computeroutput> which
        contains the glue layer for all target platforms (i.e. XPCOM, MSCOM
        and web services).</para>

        <para>To start the shell, perform the following commands:
        <screen>/opt/VirtualBox/vboxwebsrv -t 0
            # start web service with object autocollection disabled
export VBOX_PROGRAM_PATH=/opt/VirtualBox
            # your VirtualBox installation directory
export VBOX_SDK_PATH=/home/youruser/vbox-sdk
            # where you've extracted the SDK
./vboxshell.py -w        </screen>
        See <xref linkend="vboxshell"/> for more
        details on the shell's functionality. For you, as a VirtualBox
        application developer, the vboxshell sample could be interesting as an
        example of how to write code targeting both local and remote cases
        (COM/XPCOM and SOAP). The common part of the shell is the same -- the
        only difference is how it interacts with the invocation layer. You can
        use the <computeroutput>connect</computeroutput> shell command to
        connect to remote VirtualBox servers; in this case you can skip
        starting the local web server.</para>

      <title>Using the raw web service with any language</title>

      <para>The following examples show you how to use the raw web service,
      without the object-oriented client-side code that was described in the
      previous chapter.</para>

      <para>Generally, when reading the documentation in <xref
      linkend="sdkref_classes"/> and <xref linkend="sdkref_enums"/>, due to
      the limitations of SOAP and WSDL lined out in <xref
      linkend="rawws-conventions"/>, please have the following notes in
      mind:</para>

      <para><orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Any COM method call becomes a <emphasis role="bold">plain
            function call</emphasis> in the raw web service, with the object
            as an additional first parameter (before the "real" parameters
            listed in the documentation). So when the documentation says that
            the <computeroutput>IVirtualBox</computeroutput> interface
            supports the <computeroutput>createMachine()</computeroutput>
            method (see
            <link linkend="IVirtualBox__createMachine">IVirtualBox::createMachine()</link>),
            the web service operation is
            <computeroutput>IVirtualBox_createMachine(...)</computeroutput>,
            and a managed object reference to an
            <computeroutput>IVirtualBox</computeroutput> object must be passed
            as the first argument.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>For <emphasis role="bold">attributes</emphasis> in
            interfaces, there will be at least one "get" function; there will
            also be a "set" function, unless the attribute is "readonly". The
            attribute name will be appended to the "get" or "set" prefix, with
            a capitalized first letter. So, the "version" readonly attribute
            of the <computeroutput>IVirtualBox</computeroutput> interface can
            be retrieved by calling
            <computeroutput>IVirtualBox_getVersion(vbox)</computeroutput>,
            with <computeroutput>vbox</computeroutput> being the VirtualBox
            object.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Whenever the API documentation says that a method (or an
            attribute getter) returns an <emphasis
            role="bold">object</emphasis>, it will returned a managed object
            reference in the web service instead. As said above, managed
            object references should be released if the web service client
            does not log off again immediately!</para>

        </orderedlist></para>

      <para></para>

      <sect2 id="webservice-java-sample">
        <title>Raw web service example for Java with Axis</title>

        <para>Axis is an older web service toolkit created by the Apache
        foundation. If your distribution does not have it installed, you can
        get a binary from <ulink
        url="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</ulink>. The
        following examples assume that you have Axis 1.4 installed.</para>

        <para>The VirtualBox SDK ships with an example for Axis that, again,
        is called <computeroutput>clienttest.java</computeroutput> and that
        imitates a few of the commands of
        <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> over the wire.</para>

        <para>Then perform the following steps:<orderedlist>

              <para>Create a working directory somewhere. Under your
              VirtualBox installation directory, find the
              <computeroutput>sdk/webservice/samples/java/axis/</computeroutput>

              <computeroutput>clienttest.java</computeroutput> to your working
              directory.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Open a terminal in your working directory. Execute the

              <para>The <computeroutput>vboxwebService.wsdl</computeroutput>

              <para>If this fails, your Apache Axis may not be located on your

              <screen>export CLASSPATH="/path-to-axis-1_4/lib/*":$CLASSPATH</screen></para>

              <para>Use the directory where the Axis JAR files are located.
              Mind the quotes so that your shell passes the "*" character to
              the java executable without expanding. Alternatively, add a
              corresponding <computeroutput>-classpath</computeroutput>

              by the WSDL file.</para>

              <para>This is the bit that makes using web services so
              attractive to client developers: if a language's toolkit
              understands WSDL, it can generate large amounts of support code
              automatically. Clients can then easily use this support code and
              can be done with just a few lines of code.</para>

        <title>Programming considerations for the raw web service</title>

        <para>If you use the raw web service, you need to keep a number of
        things in mind, or you will sooner or later run into issues that are
        not immediately obvious. By contrast, the object-oriented client-side
        libraries described in <xref linkend="glue"/> take care of these
        things automatically and thus greatly simplify using the web
        service.</para>

        <sect3 id="rawws-conventions">
          <title>Fundamental conventions</title>

          <para>If you are familiar with other web services, you may find the
          VirtualBox web service to behave a bit differently to accommodate
          for the fact that VirtualBox web service more or less maps the
          VirtualBox Main COM API. The following main differences had to be
          taken care of:<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Web services, as expressed by WSDL, are not
                object-oriented. Even worse, they are normally stateless (or,
                in web services terminology, "loosely coupled"). Web service
                operations are entirely procedural, and one cannot normally
                make assumptions about the state of a web service between
                function calls.</para>

                <para>In particular, this normally means that you cannot work
                on objects in one method call that were created by another
                call.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>By contrast, the VirtualBox Main API, being expressed in
                COM, is object-oriented and works entirely on objects, which
                are grouped into public interfaces, which in turn have
                attributes and methods associated with them.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist> For the VirtualBox web service, this results in
          three fundamental conventions:<orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>All <emphasis role="bold">function names</emphasis> in
                the VirtualBox web service consist of an interface name and a
                method name, joined together by an underscore. This is because
                there are only functions ("operations") in WSDL, but no
                classes, interfaces, or methods.</para>

                <para>In addition, all calls to the VirtualBox web service
                (except for logon, see below) take a <emphasis
                role="bold">managed object reference</emphasis> as the first
                argument, representing the object upon which the underlying
                method is invoked. (Managed object references are explained in
                detail below; see <xref
                linkend="managed-object-references"/>.)</para>

                <para>So, when one would normally code, in the pseudo-code of
                an object-oriented language, to invoke a method upon an
                object:<screen>IMachine machine;
result = machine.getName();</screen></para>

                <para>In the VirtualBox web service, this looks something like
                this (again, pseudo-code):<screen>IMachineRef machine;
result = IMachine_getName(machine);</screen></para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>To make the web service stateful, and objects persistent
                between method calls, the VirtualBox web service introduces a
                <emphasis role="bold">session manager</emphasis> (by way of the
                 <link linkend="IWebsessionManager">IWebsessionManager</link>
                interface), which manages object references. Any client wishing
                to interact with the web service must first log on to the
                session manager and in turn receives a managed object reference
                to an object that supports the
                <link linkend="IVirtualBox">IVirtualBox</link>
                interface (the basic interface in the Main API).</para>
              </listitem>
            </orderedlist></para>

          <para>In other words, as opposed to other web services, <emphasis
          role="bold">the VirtualBox web service is both object-oriented and
          stateful.</emphasis></para>

          <title>Example: A typical web service client session</title>

          <para>A typical short web service session to retrieve the version
          number of the VirtualBox web service (to be precise, the underlying
          Main API version number) looks like this:<orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>A client logs on to the web service by calling
                <link linkend="IWebsessionManager__logon">IWebsessionManager::logon()</link>
                with a valid user name and password. See
                <xref linkend="websrv_authenticate"/>
                for details about how authentication works.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>On the server side,
                <computeroutput>vboxwebsrv</computeroutput> creates a session,
                which persists until the client calls
                <link linkend="IWebsessionManager__logoff">IWebsessionManager::logoff()</link>
                or the session times out after a configurable period of
                inactivity (see <xref linkend="vboxwebsrv-ref"/>).</para>

                <para>For the new session, the web service creates an instance
                of <link linkend="IVirtualBox">IVirtualBox</link>.
                This interface is the most central one in the Main API and
                allows access to all other interfaces, either through
                attributes or method calls. For example, IVirtualBox contains
                a list of all virtual machines that are currently registered
                (as they would be listed on the left side of the VirtualBox
                main program).</para>

                <para>The web service then creates a managed object reference
                for this instance of IVirtualBox and returns it to the calling
                client, which receives it as the return value of the logon
                call. Something like this:</para>

                <screen>string oVirtualBox;
oVirtualBox = webservice.IWebsessionManager_logon("user", "pass");</screen>

                <para>(The managed object reference "oVirtualBox" is just a
                string consisting of digits and dashes. However, it is a
                string with a meaning and will be checked by the web service.
                For details, see below. As hinted above,
                <link linkend="IWebsessionManager__logon">IWebsessionManager::logon()</link>
                is the <emphasis>only</emphasis> operation provided by the web
                service which does not take a managed object reference as the
                first argument!)</para>

              <listitem>

                attribute, which is a string. For each attribute, there is a
                "get" and a "set" method in COM, which maps to according
                operations in the web service. So, to retrieve the "version"
                attribute of this <computeroutput>IVirtualBox</computeroutput>
                object, the web service client does this:
                <screen>string version;
version = webservice.IVirtualBox_getVersion(oVirtualBox);

print version;</screen></para>

                <para>And it will print

          <title>Managed object references</title>

          <para>To a web service client, a managed object reference looks like
          a string: two 64-bit hex numbers separated by a dash. This string,
          however, represents a COM object that "lives" in the web service
          process. The two 64-bit numbers encoded in the managed object
          reference represent a session ID (which is the same for all objects
          in the same web service session, i.e. for all objects after one
          logon) and a unique object ID within that session.</para>

          <para>Managed object references are created in two
          situations:<orderedlist>

                <para>Upon logon, the websession manager creates one instance
                of <link linkend="IVirtualBox">IVirtualBox</link>,
                which can be used for directly performing calls to its
                methods, or used as a parameter for calling some methods of

                <para>(Technically, there is always only one
                <link linkend="IVirtualBox">IVirtualBox</link> object, which
                is shared between all websessions and clients, as it is a COM

                <para>Whenever a web service clients invokes an operation
                whose COM implementation creates COM objects.</para>

                <para>For example,
                <link linkend="IVirtualBox__createMachine">IVirtualBox::createMachine()</link>
                creates a new instance of
                <link linkend="IMachine">IMachine</link>;
                the COM object returned by the COM method call is then wrapped
                into a managed object reference by the web server, and this
                reference is returned to the web service client.</para>
              </listitem>
            </orderedlist></para>

          <para>Internally, in the web service process, each managed object
          reference is simply a small data structure, containing a COM pointer
          to the "real" COM object, the web session ID and the object ID. This
          structure is allocated on creation and stored efficiently in hashes,
          so that the web service can look up the COM object quickly whenever
          a web service client wishes to make a method call. The random
          session ID also ensures that one web service client cannot intercept
          the objects of another.</para>

          <para>Managed object references are not destroyed automatically and
          must be released by explicitly calling
          <link linkend="IManagedObjectRef__release">IManagedObjectRef::release()</link>.
          This is important, as
          otherwise hundreds or thousands of managed object references (and
          corresponding COM objects, which can consume much more memory!) can
          pile up in the web service process and eventually cause it to deny
          service.</para>

          <para>To reiterate: The underlying COM object, which the reference
          points to, is only freed if the managed object reference is
          released. It is therefore vital that web service clients properly
          clean up after the managed object references that are returned to
          them.</para>

          <para>When a web service client calls
          <link linkend="IWebsessionManager__logoff">IWebsessionManager::logoff()</link>,
          all managed object references created during the session are
          automatically freed. For short-lived sessions that do not create a
          lot of objects, logging off may therefore be sufficient, although it
          is certainly not "best practice".</para>

            <para>Whenever a client makes a call to a web service, this
            involves a complicated procedure internally. These calls are
            remote procedure calls. Each such procedure call typically
            consists of two "message" being passed, where each message is a
            plain-text HTTP request with a standard HTTP header and a special
            XML document following. This XML document encodes the name of the
            procedure to call and the argument names and values passed to
            it.</para>

            <para>To give you an idea of what such a message looks like,
            assuming that a web service provides a procedure called
            "SayHello", which takes a string "name" as an argument and returns
            "Hello" with a space and that name appended, the request message
            could look like this:</para>

            <title>Service descriptions in WSDL</title>

            <para>In the above explanations about SOAP, it was left open how
            the programming language learns about how to translate function
            calls in its own syntax into proper SOAP messages. In other words,
            the programming language needs to know what operations the web
            service supports and what types of arguments are required for the
            operation's data in order to be able to properly serialize and
            deserialize the data to and from the web service. For example, if
            a web service operation expects a number in "double" floating
            point format for a particular parameter, the programming language
            cannot send to it a string instead.</para>

            <para>For this, the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) was
            invented, another XML substandard that describes exactly what
            operations the web service supports and, for each operation, which
            parameters and types are needed with each request and response
            message. WSDL descriptions can be incredibly verbose, and one of
            the few good things that can be said about this standard is that
            it is indeed supported by most programming languages.</para>

            <para>So, if it is said that a programming language "supports" web
            services, this typically means that a programming language has
            support for parsing WSDL files and somehow integrating the remote
            procedure calls into the native language syntax -- for example,

      <title>Using COM/XPCOM directly</title>

      <para>If you do not require <emphasis>remote</emphasis> procedure calls
      such as those offered by the VirtualBox web service, and if you know
      Python or C++ as well as COM, you might find it preferable to program
      VirtualBox's Main API directly via COM.</para>

      <para>COM stands for "Component Object Model" and is a standard
      originally introduced by Microsoft in the 1990s for Microsoft Windows.
      It allows for organizing software in an object-oriented way and across
      processes; code in one process may access objects that live in another
      process.</para>

      <para>COM has several advantages: it is language-neutral, meaning that
      even though all of VirtualBox is internally written in C++, programs
      written in other languages could communicate with it. COM also cleanly
      separates interface from implementation, so that external programs need
      not know anything about the messy and complicated details of VirtualBox
      internals.</para>

      <para>On a Windows host, all parts of VirtualBox will use the COM
      functionality that is native to Windows. On other hosts (including
      Linux), VirtualBox comes with a built-in implementation of XPCOM, as
      originally created by the Mozilla project, which we have enhanced to
      support interprocess communication on a level comparable to Microsoft
      COM. Internally, VirtualBox has an abstraction layer that allows the
      same VirtualBox code to work both with native COM as well as our XPCOM
      implementation.</para>

      <sect2 id="pycom">
        <title>Python COM API</title>

        <para>On Windows, Python scripts can use COM and VirtualBox interfaces
        to control almost all aspects of virtual machine execution. As an

      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="glue-python">
        <title>Common Python bindings layer</title>

        <para>As different wrappers ultimately provide access to the same
        underlying API, and to simplify porting and development of Python
        application using the VirtualBox Main API, we developed a common glue
        layer that abstracts out most platform-specific details from the
        application and allows the developer to focus on application logic.
        The VirtualBox installer automatically sets up this glue layer for the
        system default Python install. See below for details on how to set up
        the glue layer if you want to use a different Python
        installation.</para>

        <para>The minimum supported Python version is 2.6.</para>

        <para>In this layer, the class
        <computeroutput>VirtualBoxManager</computeroutput> hides most
        platform-specific details. It can be used to access both the local
        (COM) and the web service based API. The following code can be used by
        an application to use the glue layer.</para>

        <screen># This code assumes vboxapi.py from VirtualBox distribution
# being in PYTHONPATH, or installed system-wide
from vboxapi import VirtualBoxManager

# This code initializes VirtualBox manager with default style
# and parameters
virtualBoxManager = VirtualBoxManager(None, None)

# Alternatively, one can be more verbose, and initialize
# glue with web service backend, and provide authentication
# information
virtualBoxManager = VirtualBoxManager("WEBSERVICE",
                                      {'url':'http://myhost.com::18083/',
                                      'user':'me',
                                      'password':'secret'})        </screen>

        <para>We supply the <computeroutput>VirtualBoxManager</computeroutput>
        constructor with 2 arguments: style and parameters. Style defines
        which bindings style to use (could be "MSCOM", "XPCOM" or
        "WEBSERVICE"), and if set to <computeroutput>None</computeroutput>
        defaults to usable platform bindings (MS COM on Windows, XPCOM on
        other platforms). The second argument defines parameters, passed to
        the platform-specific module, as we do in the second example, where we
        pass username and password to be used to authenticate against the web
        service.</para>

        <para>After obtaining the
        <computeroutput>VirtualBoxManager</computeroutput> instance, one can
        perform operations on the IVirtualBox class. For example, the
        following code will a start virtual machine by name or ID:</para>

        <screen>from vboxapi import VirtualBoxManager
mgr = VirtualBoxManager(None, None)
vbox = mgr.vbox
name = "Linux"
mach = vbox.findMachine(name)
session = mgr.getSessionObject(vbox)
progress = mach.launchVMProcess(session, "gui", "")
progress.waitForCompletion(-1)
mgr.closeMachineSession(session)
        </screen>
        <para>
          Following code will print all registered machines and their log
          folders
        </para>
        <screen>from vboxapi import VirtualBoxManager
mgr = VirtualBoxManager(None, None)
vbox = mgr.vbox

for m in mgr.getArray(vbox, 'machines'):
print "Machine '%s' logs in '%s'" %(m.name, m.logFolder)
        </screen>

        <para>Code above demonstrates cross-platform access to array properties
        (certain limitations prevent one from using
        <computeroutput>vbox.machines</computeroutput> to access a list of
        available virtual machines in case of XPCOM), and a mechanism of
        uniform session creation and closing
        (<computeroutput>mgr.getSessionObject()</computeroutput>).</para>

        <para>In case you want to use the glue layer with a different Python
        installation, use these steps in a shell to add the necessary
        files:</para>

        <title>C++ COM API</title>

        <para>C++ is the language that VirtualBox itself is written in, so C++
        is the most direct way to use the Main API -- but it is not
        necessarily the easiest, as using COM and XPCOM has its own set of
        complications.</para>

        <para>VirtualBox ships with sample programs that demonstrate how to
        use the Main API to implement a number of tasks on your host platform.
        These samples can be found in the
        <computeroutput>/bindings/xpcom/samples</computeroutput> directory for
        Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris and
        <computeroutput>/bindings/mscom/samples</computeroutput> for Windows.
        The two samples are actually different, because the one for Windows
        uses native COM, whereas the other uses our XPCOM implementation, as
        described above.</para>

        <para>Since COM and XPCOM are conceptually very similar but vary in
        the implementation details, we have created a "glue" layer that
        shields COM client code from these differences. All VirtualBox uses is
        this glue layer, so the same code written once works on both Windows
        hosts (with native COM) as well as on other hosts (with our XPCOM
        implementation). It is recommended to always use this glue code
        instead of using the COM and XPCOM APIs directly, as it is very easy
        to make your code completely independent from the platform it is
        running on.<!--    A third sample,
        <computeroutput>tstVBoxAPIGlue.cpp</computeroutput>, illustrates how to
        use the glue layer.
--></para>

        <para>In order to encapsulate platform differences between Microsoft
        COM and XPCOM, the following items should be kept in mind when using
        the glue layer:</para>

        <para><orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">Attribute getters and
              setters.</emphasis> COM has the notion of "attributes" in
              interfaces, which roughly compare to C++ member variables in
              classes. The difference is that for each attribute declared in
              an interface, COM automatically provides a "get" method to
              return the attribute's value. Unless the attribute has been
              marked as "readonly", a "set" attribute is also provided.</para>

              <para>To illustrate, the IVirtualBox interface has a "version"
              attribute, which is read-only and of the "wstring" type (the
              standard string type in COM). As a result, you can call the
              "get" method for this attribute to retrieve the version number
              of VirtualBox.</para>

              <para>Unfortunately, the implementation differs between COM and
              XPCOM. Microsoft COM names the "get" method like this:
              <computeroutput>get_Attribute()</computeroutput>, whereas XPCOM
              uses this syntax:
              <computeroutput>GetAttribute()</computeroutput> (and accordingly
              for "set" methods). To hide these differences, the VirtualBox
              glue code provides the
              <computeroutput>COMGETTER(attrib)</computeroutput> and
              <computeroutput>COMSETTER(attrib)</computeroutput> macros. So,
              <computeroutput>COMGETTER(version)()</computeroutput> (note, two
              pairs of brackets) expands to
              <computeroutput>get_Version()</computeroutput> on Windows and

              While the rest of the modern world has pretty much settled on

              encoding. This requires a lot of conversions, in particular
              between the VirtualBox Main API and the Qt GUI, which, like the

        <title>Event queue processing</title>

        <para>Both VirtualBox client programs and frontends should
        periodically perform processing of the main event queue, and do that
        on the application's main thread. In case of a typical GUI Windows/Mac
        OS application this happens automatically in the GUI's dispatch loop.
        However, for CLI only application, the appropriate actions have to be
        taken. For C++ applications, the VirtualBox SDK provided glue method
        <screen>
            int EventQueue::processEventQueue(uint32_t cMsTimeout)
         </screen> can be used for both blocking and non-blocking operations.
        For the Python bindings, a common layer provides the method <screen>
          VirtualBoxManager.waitForEvents(ms)
         </screen> with similar semantics.</para>

        <para>Things get somewhat more complicated for situations where an
        application using VirtualBox cannot directly control the main event
        loop and the main event queue is separated from the event queue of the
        programming librarly (for example in case of Qt on Unix platforms). In
        such a case, the application developer is advised to use a
        platform/toolkit specific event injection mechanism to force event
        queue checks either based on periodical timer events delivered to the
        main thread, or by using custom platform messages to notify the main
        thread when events are available. See the VBoxSDL and Qt (VirtualBox)
        frontends as examples.</para>

          which demonstrates
          using the C binding to initialize the API, get handles for
          VirtualBox and Session objects, make calls to list and start virtual
          machines, monitor events, and uninitialize resources when done. The

          <computeroutput>VBoxCAPI_v4_3.h</computeroutput> header provides the
          interface to the C binding, but you can alternatively and more
          conveniently also include

          <para>It is possible to write C applications using multiple threads
          which all use the VirtualBox API, as long as you're initializing
          the C API in each thread which your application creates. This is done
          with <code>g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnClientThreadInitialize()</code> and
          likewise before the thread is terminated the API must be
          uninitialized with
          <code>g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnClientThreadUninitialize()</code>. You don't
          have to use these functions in worker threads created by COM/XPCOM
          (which you might observe if your code uses active event handling),
          everything is initialized correctly already. On Windows the C
          bindings create a marshaller which supports a wide range of COM
          threading models, from STA to MTA, so you don't have to worry about
          these details unless you plan to use active event handlers. See
          the sample code how to get this to work reliably (in other words
          think twice if passive event handling isn't the better solution after
          you looked at the sample code).</para>

        <sect3 id="c-invocation">
          <title>C API attribute and method invocation</title>

          <para>Method invocation is straightforward. It looks pretty much
          like the C++ way, by using a macro which internally accesses the
          vtable, and additionally needs to be passed a pointer to the objecti
          as the first argument to serve as the
          <computeroutput>this</computeroutput> pointer.</para>

          <para>Using the C binding, all method invocations return a numeric
          result code of type <code>HRESULT</code> (with a few exceptions
          which normally are not relevant).</para>

          <para>If an interface is specified as returning an object, a pointer
          to a pointer to the appropriate object must be passed as the last
          argument. The method will then store an object pointer in that
          location.</para>

          <para>Likewise, attributes (properties) can be queried or set using
          method invocations, using specially named methods. For each
          attribute there exists a getter method, the name of which is composed
          of <computeroutput>get_</computeroutput> followed by the capitalized
          attribute name. Unless the attribute is read-only, an analogous
          <computeroutput>set_</computeroutput> method exists. Let's apply
          these rules to get the <computeroutput>IVirtualBox</computeroutput>
          reference, an <computeroutput>ISession</computeroutput> instance
          reference and read the
          <link linkend="IVirtualBox__revision">IVirtualBox::revision</link>
          attribute:
          <screen>rc = IVirtualBoxClient_get_VirtualBox(vboxclient, &amp;vbox);
if (FAILED(rc) || !vbox)

rc = IVirtualBoxClient_get_Session(vboxclient, &amp;session);
if (FAILED(rc) || !session)

}</screen></para>

          <para>The convenience macros for calling a method are named by

rc = IVirtualBox_FindMachine(vbox, vmname, &amp;machine);</screen></para>

          <para>As a more complicated example of a method invocation, let's
          call
          <link linkend="IMachine__launchVMProcess">IMachine::launchVMProcess</link>
          which returns an IProgress object. Note again that the method name is

        <sect3 id="c-string-handling">
          <title>String handling</title>

          <para>When dealing with strings you have to be aware of a string's
          encoding and ownership.</para>

          <para>Internally, the API uses UTF-16 encoded strings. A set of
          conversion functions is provided to convert other encodings to and
          from UTF-16. The type of a UTF-16 character is
          <computeroutput>BSTR</computeroutput> (or its constant counterpart
          <computeroutput>CBSTR</computeroutput>), which is an array type,
          represented by a pointer to the start of the zero-terminated string.
          There are functions for converting between UTF-8 and UTF-16 strings
          available through <code>g_pVBoxFuncs</code>:
          <screen>int (*pfnUtf16ToUtf8)(CBSTR pwszString, char **ppszString);
int (*pfnUtf8ToUtf16)(const char *pszString, BSTR *ppwszString);</screen></para>

          <para>The ownership of a string determines who is responsible for
          releasing resources associated with the string. Whenever the API
          creates a string (essentially for output parameters), ownership is
          transferred to the caller. To avoid resource leaks, the caller
          should release resources once the string is no longer needed.
          There are plenty of examples in the sample code.</para>

        <sect3 id="c-safearray">
          <title>Array handling</title>

          <para>Arrays are handled somewhat similarly to strings, with the
          additional information of the number of elements in the array. The
          exact details of string passing depends on the platform middleware
          (COM/XPCOM), and therefore the C binding offers helper functions to
          gloss over these differences.</para>

          <para>Passing arrays as input parameters to API methods is usually
          done by the following sequence, calling a hypothetical
          <code>IArrayDemo_PassArray</code> API method:
          <screen>static const ULONG aElements[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
ULONG cElements = sizeof(aElements) / sizeof(aElements[0]);
SAFEARRAY *psa = NULL;
psa = g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayCreateVector(VT_I4, 0, cElements);
g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayCopyInParamHelper(psa, aElements, sizeof(aElements));
IArrayDemo_PassArray(pThis, ComSafeArrayAsInParam(psa));
g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayDestroy(psa);</screen></para>

          <para>Likewise, getting arrays results from output parameters is done
          using helper functions which manage memory allocations as part of
          their other functionality:
          <screen>SAFEARRAY *psa = g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayOutParamAlloc();
ULONG *pData;
ULONG cElements;
IArrayDemo_ReturnArray(pThis, ComSafeArrayAsOutTypeParam(psa, ULONG));
g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayCopyOutParamHelper((void **)&amp;pData, &amp;cElements, VT_I4, psa);
g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayDestroy(psa);</screen></para>

          <para>This covers the necessary functionality for all array element
          types except interface references. These need special helpers to
          manage the reference counting correctly. The following code snippet
          gets the list of VMs, and passes the first IMachine reference to
          another API function (assuming that there is at least one element
          in the array, to simplify the example):
          <screen>SAFEARRAY psa = g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayOutParamAlloc();
IMachine **machines = NULL;
ULONG machineCnt = 0;
ULONG i;
IVirtualBox_get_Machines(virtualBox, ComSafeArrayAsOutIfaceParam(machinesSA, IMachine *));
g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayCopyOutIfaceParamHelper((IUnknown ***)&amp;machines, &amp;machineCnt, machinesSA);
g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayDestroy(machinesSA);
/* Now "machines" contains the IMachine references, and machineCnt the
 * number of elements in the array. */
...
SAFEARRAY *psa = g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayCreateVector(VT_IUNKNOWN, 0, 1);
g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnSafeArrayCopyInParamHelper(psa, (void *)&amp;machines[0], sizeof(machines[0]));

{
    IMachine *machine = machines[i];
    IMachine_Release(machine);
}
free(machines);</screen></para>

          <para>Handling output parameters needs more special effort than

        <sect3 id="c-eventhandling">
          <title>Event handling</title>

          <para>The VirtualBox API offers two types of event handling, active
          and passive, and consequently there is support for both with the
          C API binding. Active event handling (based on asynchronous
          callback invocation for event delivery) is more difficult, as it
          requires the construction of valid C++ objects in C, which is
          inherently platform and compiler dependent. Passive event handling
          is much simpler, it relies on an event loop, fetching events and
          triggering the necessary handlers explicitly in the API client code.
          Both approaches depend on an event loop to make sure that events
          get delivered in a timely manner, with differences what exactly needs
          to be done.</para>

          <para>The C API sample contains code for both event handling styles,
          and one has to modify the appropriate <code>#define</code> to select
          which style is actually used by the compiled program. It allows a
          good comparison between the two variants, and the code sequences are
          probably worth reusing without much change in other API clients
          with only minor adaptions.</para>

          <para>Active event handling needs to ensure that the following helper
          function is called frequently enough in the primary thread:
          <screen>g_pVBoxFuncs->pfnProcessEventQueue(cTimeoutMS);</screen></para>

          <para>The actual event handler implementation is quite tedious, as
          it has to implement a complete API interface. Especially on Windows
          it is a lot of work to implement the complicated
          <code>IDispatch</code> interface, requiring to load COM type
          information and using it in the <code>IDispatch</code> method
          implementation. Overall this is quite tedious compared to passive
          event handling.</para>

          <para>Passive event handling uses a similar event loop structure,
          which requires calling the following function in a loop, and
          processing the returned event appropriately:
          <screen>rc = IEventSource_GetEvent(pEventSource, pListener, cTimeoutMS, &amp;pEvent);</screen></para>

          <para>After processing the event it needs to be marked as processed
          with the following method call:
          <screen>rc = IEventSource_EventProcessed(pEventSource, pListener, pEvent);</screen></para>

          <para>This is vital for vetoable events, as they would be stuck
          otherwise, waiting whether the veto comes or not. It does not do any
          harm for other event types, and in the end is cheaper than checking
          if the event at hand is vetoable or not.</para>

          <para>The general event handling concepts are described in the API
          specification (see <xref linkend="events"/>), including how to
          aggregate multiple event sources for processing in one event loop.
          As mentioned, the sample illustrates the practical aspects of how to
          use both types of event handling, active and passive, from a C
          application. Additional hints are in the comments documenting
          the helper methods in
          <computeroutput>VBoxCAPI_v4_3.h</computeroutput>. The code complexity
          of active event handling (and its inherenly platform/compiler
          specific aspects) should be motivation to use passive event handling
          whereever possible.</para>

          <para>If you expect the program to be terminated by a signal (e.g.

          eventually release references held by the client. On Windows it can

          <title>Conversion of code using legacy C binding</title>

          <para>This section aims to make the task of converting code using
          the legacy C binding to the new style a breeze, by pointing out some
          key steps.</para>

          <para>One necessary change is adjusting your Makefile to reflect the
          different include paths. See above. There are now 3 relevant include
          directories, and most of it is pointing to the C binding directory.
          The XPCOM include directory is still relevant for platforms where
          the XPCOM middleware is used, but most of the include files live
          elsewhere now, so it's good to have it last. Additionally the
          <computeroutput>VirtualBox_i.c</computeroutput> file needs to be
          compiled and linked to the program, it contains the IIDs relevant
          for the VirtualBox API, making sure they are not replicated endlessly
          if the code refers to them frequently.</para>

          <para>The C API client code should include
          <computeroutput>VBoxCAPIGlue.h</computeroutput> instead of
          <computeroutput>VBoxXPCOMCGlue.h</computeroutput> or
          <computeroutput>VBoxCAPI_v4_3.h</computeroutput>, as this makes sure
          the correct macros and internal translations are selected.</para>

          <para>All API method calls (anything mentioning <code>vtbl</code>)
          should be rewritten using the convenience macros for calling methods,
          as these hide the internal details, are generally easier to use and
          shorter to type. You should remove as many as possible
          <code>(nsISupports **)</code> or similar typecasts, as the new style
          should use the correct type in most places, increasing the type
          safety in case of an error in the source code.</para>

          <para>To gloss over the platform differences, API client code should
          no longer rely on XPCOM specific interface names such as
          <code>nsISupports</code>, <code>nsIException</code> and
          <code>nsIEventQueue</code>, and replace them by the platform
          independent interface names <code>IUnknown</code> and
          <code>IErrorInfo</code> for the first two respectively. Event queue
          handling should be replaced by using the platform independent way
          described in <xref linkend="c-eventhandling"/>.</para>

          <para>Finally adjust the string and array handling to use the new
          helpers, as these make sure the code works without changes with
          both COM and XPCOM, which are significantly different in this area.
          The code should be double checked if it uses the correct way to
          manage memory, and is freeing it only after the last use.</para>

    <title>Basic VirtualBox concepts; some examples</title>

    <para>The following explains some basic VirtualBox concepts such as the
    VirtualBox object, sessions and how virtual machines are manipulated and
    launched using the Main API. The coding examples use a pseudo-code style
    closely related to the object-oriented web service (OOWS) for JAX-WS.
    Depending on which environment you are using, you will need to adjust the
    examples.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Obtaining basic machine information. Reading attributes</title>

      <para>Any program using the Main API will first need access to the
      global VirtualBox object (see
      <link linkend="IVirtualBox">IVirtualBox</link>), from which all other
      functionality of the API is derived. With the OOWS for JAX-WS, this is
      returned from the
      <link linkend="IWebsessionManager__logon">IWebsessionManager::logon()</link>
      call.</para>

      <para>To enumerate virtual machines, one would look at the "machines"
      array attribute in the VirtualBox object (see
      <link linkend="IVirtualBox__machines">IVirtualBox::machines</link>).
      This array contains all virtual machines currently registered with the
      host, each of them being an instance of
      <link linkend="IMachine">IMachine</link>.
      From each such instance, one can query additional information, such as
      the UUID, the name, memory, operating system and more by looking at the
      attributes; see the attributes list in
      <link linkend="IMachine">IMachine</link> documentation.</para>

      <para>As mentioned in the preceding chapters, depending on your
      programming environment, attributes are mapped to corresponding "get"
      and (if the attribute is not read-only) "set" methods. So when the
      documentation says that IMachine has a
      "<link linkend="IMachine__name">name</link>" attribute, this means you
      need to code something
      like the following to get the machine's name:
      <screen>IMachine machine = ...;
String name = machine.getName();</screen>
      Boolean attribute getters can sometimes be called
      <computeroutput>isAttribute()</computeroutput> due to JAX-WS naming
      conventions.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Changing machine settings: Sessions</title>

      <para>As said in the previous section, to read a machine's attribute,
      one invokes the corresponding "get" method. One would think that to
      change settings of a machine, it would suffice to call the corresponding
      "set" method -- for example, to set a VM's memory to 1024 MB, one would
      call <computeroutput>setMemorySize(1024)</computeroutput>. Try that, and
      you will get an error: "The machine is not mutable."</para>

      <para>So unfortunately, things are not that easy. VirtualBox is a
      complicated environment in which multiple processes compete for possibly
      the same resources, especially machine settings. As a result, machines
      must be "locked" before they can either be modified or started. This is
      to prevent multiple processes from making conflicting changes to a
      machine: it should, for example, not be allowed to change the memory
      size of a virtual machine while it is running. (You can't add more
      memory to a real computer while it is running either, at least not to an
      ordinary PC.) Also, two processes must not change settings at the same
      time, or start a machine at the same time.</para>

      <para>These requirements are implemented in the Main API by way of
      "sessions", in particular, the <link linkend="ISession">ISession</link>
      interface. Each process which talks to
      VirtualBox needs its own instance of ISession. In the web service, you
      can request the creation of such an object by calling
      <link linkend="IWebsessionManager__getSessionObject">IWebsessionManager::getSessionObject()</link>.
      More complex management tasks might need multiple instances of ISession,
      and each call returns a new one.</para>

      <para>This session object must then be used like a mutex semaphore in
      common programming environments. Before you can change machine settings,
      you must write-lock the machine by calling
      <link linkend="IMachine__lockMachine">IMachine::lockMachine()</link>
      with your process's session object.</para>

      <para>After the machine has been locked, the
      <link linkend="ISession__machine">ISession::machine</link> attribute
      contains a copy of the original IMachine object upon which the session
      was opened, but this copy is "mutable": you can invoke "set" methods on
      it.</para>

      <para>When done making the changes to the machine, you must call
      <link linkend="IMachine__saveSettings">IMachine::saveSettings()</link>,
      which will copy the changes you have made from your "mutable" machine
      back to the real machine and write them out to the machine settings XML
      file. This will make your changes permanent.</para>

      <para>Finally, it is important to always unlock the machine again, by
      calling
      <link linkend="ISession__unlockMachine">ISession::unlockMachine()</link>.
      Otherwise, when the calling process end, the machine will receive the
      "aborted" state, which can lead to loss of data.</para>

      <para>So, as an example, the sequence to change a machine's memory to
      1024 MB is something like this:<screen>IWebsessionManager mgr ...;
IVirtualBox vbox = mgr.logon(user, pass);
...
IMachine machine = ...;  // read-only machine
ISession session = mgr.getSessionObject();
machine.lockMachine(session, LockType.Write); // machine is now locked for writing
IMachine mutable = session.getMachine();      // obtain the mutable machine copy
mutable.setMemorySize(1024);
mutable.saveSettings();                       // write settings to XML
session.unlockMachine();</screen></para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Launching virtual machines</title>

      <para>To launch a virtual machine, you call
      <link linkend="IMachine__launchVMProcess">IMachine::launchVMProcess()</link>.
      In doing so, the caller instructs the VirtualBox engine to start a new
      process with the virtual machine in it, since to the host, each virtual
      machine looks like single process, even if it has hundreds of its own
      processes inside. (This new VM process in turn obtains a write lock on
      the machine, as described above, to prevent conflicting changes from
      other processes; this is why opening another session will fail while the
      VM is running.)</para>

      <para>Starting a machine looks something like this:
      <screen>IWebsessionManager mgr ...;
IVirtualBox vbox = mgr.logon(user, pass);
...
IMachine machine = ...;  // read-only machine
ISession session = mgr.getSessionObject();
IProgress prog = machine.launchVMProcess(session,
                                         "gui",  // session type
                                         "");    // possibly environment setting
prog.waitForCompletion(10000);  // give the process 10 secs
if (prog.getResultCode() != 0)  // check success
    System.out.println("Cannot launch VM!")</screen></para>

      <para>The caller's session object can then be used as a sort of remote
      control to the VM process that was launched. It contains a "console"
      object (see <link linkend="ISession__console">ISession::console</link>)
      with which the VM can be paused,
      stopped, snapshotted or other things.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="events">
      <title>VirtualBox events</title>

      <para>In VirtualBox, "events" provide a uniform mechanism to register
      for and consume specific events. A VirtualBox client can register an
      "event listener" (represented by the
      <link linkend="IEventListener">IEventListener</link> interface), which
      will then get notified by the server when an event (represented by the
      <link linkend="IEvent">IEvent</link> interface) happens.</para>

      <para>The IEvent interface is an abstract parent interface for all
      events that can occur in VirtualBox. The actual events that the server
      sends out are then of one of the specific subclasses, for example
      <link linkend="IMachineStateChangedEvent">IMachineStateChangedEvent</link>
      or
      <link linkend="IMediumChangedEvent">IMediumChangedEvent</link>.</para>

      <para>As an example, the VirtualBox GUI waits for machine events and can
      thus update its display when the machine state changes or machine
      settings are modified, even if this happens in another client. This is
      how the GUI can automatically refresh its display even if you manipulate
      a machine from another client, for example, from VBoxManage.</para>

      <para>To register an event listener to listen to events, use code like
      this:<screen>EventSource es = console.getEventSource();
IEventListener listener = es.createListener();
VBoxEventType aTypes[] = (VBoxEventType.OnMachineStateChanged);
        // list of event types to listen for
es.registerListener(listener, aTypes, false /* active */);
        // register passive listener
IEvent ev = es.getEvent(listener, 1000);
        // wait up to one second for event to happen
if (ev != null)
{
    // downcast to specific event interface (in this case we have only registered
    // for one type, otherwise IEvent::type would tell us)
    IMachineStateChangedEvent mcse = IMachineStateChangedEvent.queryInterface(ev);
    ... // inspect and do something
    es.eventProcessed(listener, ev);
}
...
es.unregisterListener(listener); </screen></para>

      <para>A graphical user interface would probably best start its own
      thread to wait for events and then process these in a loop.</para>

      <para>The events mechanism was introduced with VirtualBox 3.3 and
      replaces various callback interfaces which were called for each event in
      the interface. The callback mechanism was not compatible with scripting
      languages, local Java bindings and remote web services as they do not
      support callbacks. The new mechanism with events and event listeners
      works with all of these.</para>

      <para>To simplify developement of application using events, concept of
      event aggregator was introduced. Essentially it's mechanism to aggregate
      multiple event sources into single one, and then work with this single
      aggregated event source instead of original sources. As an example, one
      can evaluate demo recorder in VirtualBox Python shell, shipped with SDK
      - it records mouse and keyboard events, represented as separate event
      sources. Code is essentially like this:<screen>
          listener = console.eventSource.createListener()
          agg = console.eventSource.createAggregator([console.keyboard.eventSource, console.mouse.eventSource])
          agg.registerListener(listener, [ctx['global'].constants.VBoxEventType_Any], False)
          registered = True
          end = time.time() + dur
          while  time.time() &lt; end:
              ev = agg.getEvent(listener, 1000)
              processEent(ev)
          agg.unregisterListener(listener)</screen> Without using aggregators
      consumer have to poll on both sources, or start multiple threads to
      block on those sources.</para>

  <chapter id="vboxshell">
    <title>The VirtualBox shell</title>

    <para>VirtualBox comes with an extensible shell, which allows you to
    control your virtual machines from the command line. It is also a
    nontrivial example of how to use the VirtualBox APIs from Python, for all
    three COM/XPCOM/WS styles of the API.</para>

    <para>You can easily extend this shell with your own commands. Create a

    on a Windows system and

    <title>Host-Guest Communication Manager</title>

    <para>The VirtualBox Host-Guest Communication Manager (HGCM) allows a
    guest application or a guest driver to call a host shared library. The
    following features of VirtualBox are implemented using HGCM: <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Shared Folders</para>
        </listitem>

          <para>Guest configuration interface</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>The shared library contains a so called HGCM service. The guest HGCM
    clients establish connections to the service to call it. When calling a
    HGCM service the client supplies a function code and a number of
    parameters for the function.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Virtual hardware implementation</title>

      <para>HGCM uses the VMM virtual PCI device to exchange data between the
      guest and the host. The guest always acts as an initiator of requests. A
      request is constructed in the guest physical memory, which must be
      locked by the guest. The physical address is passed to the VMM device
      using a 32-bit <computeroutput>out edx, eax</computeroutput>
      instruction. The physical memory must be allocated below 4GB by 64-bit
      guests.</para>

      <para>The host parses the request header and data and queues the request
      for a host HGCM service. The guest continues execution and usually waits
      on a HGCM event semaphore.</para>

      <para>When the request has been processed by the HGCM service, the VMM
      device sets the completion flag in the request header, sets the HGCM
      event and raises an IRQ for the guest. The IRQ handler signals the HGCM
      event semaphore and all HGCM callers check the completion flag in the
      corresponding request header. If the flag is set, the request is
      considered completed.</para>

    <title>Drag and Drop</title>

    <para>Since VirtualBox 4.2 it's possible to transfer files from host to the
    Linux guests by dragging files, directories or text from the host into the
    guest's screen. This is called <emphasis>drag and drop
    (DnD)</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>In version 5.0 support for Windows guests has been added, as well as
    the ability to transfer data the other way around, that is, from the guest
    to the host.</para>

    <note><para>Currently only the VirtualBox Manager frontend supports drag and
      drop.</para></note>

    <para>This chapter will show how to use the required interfaces provided
    by VirtualBox for adding drag and drop functionality to third-party
    frontends.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Basic concepts</title>

      <para>In order to use the interfaces provided by VirtualBox, some basic
      concepts needs to be understood first: To successfully initiate a
      drag and drop operation at least two sides needs to be involved, a
      <emphasis>source</emphasis> and a <emphasis>target</emphasis>:</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>source</emphasis> is the side which provides the
      data, e.g. is the origin of data. This data can be stored within the
      source directly or can be retrieved on-demand by the source itself. Other
      interfaces don't care where the data from this source actually came
      from.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>target</emphasis> on the other hand is the side which
      provides the source a visual representation where the user can drop the
      data the source offers. This representation can be a window (or just a
      certain part of it), for example.</para>

      <para>The source and the target have abstract interfaces called
      <link linkend="IDnDSource">IDnDSource</link> and
      <link linkend="IDnDTarget">IDnDTarget</link>. VirtualBox also
      provides implementations of both interfaces, called
      <link linkend="IGuestDnDSource">IGuestDnDSource</link> and

    <title>VirtualBox external authentication modules</title>

    <para>VirtualBox supports arbitrary external modules to perform
    authentication. The module is used when the authentication method is set
    to "external" for a particular VM VRDE access and the library was
    specified with <computeroutput>VBoxManage setproperty
    vrdeauthlibrary</computeroutput>. Web service also use the authentication
    module which was specified with <computeroutput>VBoxManage setproperty
    websrvauthlibrary</computeroutput>.</para>

    <para>This library will be loaded by the VM or web service process on
    demand, i.e. when the first remote desktop connection is made by a client
    or when a client that wants to use the web service logs on.</para>

    <para>External authentication is the most flexible as the external handler
    can both choose to grant access to everyone (like the "null"
    authentication method would) and delegate the request to the guest
    authentication component. When delegating the request to the guest
    component, the handler will still be called afterwards with the option to
    override the result.</para>

    <para>An authentication library is required to implement exactly one entry
    point:</para>

    <screen>#include "VBoxAuth.h"

/**
 * Authentication library entry point.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *   szCaller         The name of the component which calls the library (UTF8).
 *   pUuid            Pointer to the UUID of the accessed virtual machine. Can be NULL.
 *   guestJudgement   Result of the guest authentication.
 *   szUser           User name passed in by the client (UTF8).
 *   szPassword       Password passed in by the client (UTF8).
 *   szDomain         Domain passed in by the client (UTF8).
 *   fLogon           Boolean flag. Indicates whether the entry point is called
 *                    for a client logon or the client disconnect.
 *   clientId         Server side unique identifier of the client.
 *
 * Return code:
 *
 *   AuthResultAccessDenied    Client access has been denied.
 *   AuthResultAccessGranted   Client has the right to use the
 *                             virtual machine.
 *   AuthResultDelegateToGuest Guest operating system must
 *                             authenticate the client and the
 *                             library must be called again with
 *                             the result of the guest
 *                             authentication.
 *
 * Note: When 'fLogon' is 0, only pszCaller, pUuid and clientId are valid and the return
 *       code is ignored.

    <para>A note regarding the UUID implementation of the
    <computeroutput>pUuid</computeroutput> argument: VirtualBox uses a
    consistent binary representation of UUIDs on all platforms. For this
    reason the integer fields comprising the UUID are stored as little endian
    values. If you want to pass such UUIDs to code which assumes that the
    integer fields are big endian (often also called network byte order), you
    need to adjust the contents of the UUID to e.g. achieve the same string
    representation. The required changes are:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>reverse the order of byte 0, 1, 2 and 3</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>reverse the order of byte 6 and 7.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>Using this conversion you will get identical results when
    converting the binary UUID to the string representation.</para>

    <para>The <computeroutput>guestJudgement</computeroutput> argument
    contains information about the guest authentication status. For the first
    call, it is always set to
    <computeroutput>AuthGuestNotAsked</computeroutput>. In case the
    <computeroutput>AuthEntry</computeroutput> function returns
    <computeroutput>AuthResultDelegateToGuest</computeroutput>, a guest
    authentication will be attempted and another call to the
    <computeroutput>AuthEntry</computeroutput> is made with its result. This
    can be either granted / denied or no judgement (the guest component chose
    for whatever reason to not make a decision). In case there is a problem
    with the guest authentication module (e.g. the Additions are not installed
    or not running or the guest did not respond within a timeout), the "not
    reacted" status will be returned.</para>

    <title>Using Java API</title>

    <sect1>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>VirtualBox can be controlled by a Java API, both locally
      (COM/XPCOM) and from remote (SOAP) clients. As with the Python bindings,
      a generic glue layer tries to hide all platform differences, allowing
      for source and binary compatibility on different platforms.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Requirements</title>

      <para>To use the Java bindings, there are certain requirements depending
      on the platform. First of all, you need JDK 1.5 (Java 5) or later. Also
      please make sure that the version of the VirtualBox API .jar file
      exactly matches the version of VirtualBox you use. To avoid confusion,
      the VirtualBox API provides versioning in the Java package name, e.g.
      the package is named <computeroutput>org.virtualbox_3_2</computeroutput>
      for VirtualBox version 3.2. <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">XPCOM</emphasis> - for all platforms,
            but Microsoft Windows. A Java bridge based on JavaXPCOM is shipped
            with VirtualBox. The classpath must contain
            <computeroutput>vboxjxpcom.jar</computeroutput> and the
            <computeroutput>vbox.home</computeroutput> property must be set to
            location where the VirtualBox binaries are. Please make sure that
            the JVM bitness matches bitness of VirtualBox you use as the XPCOM
            bridge relies on native libraries.</para>

            for installation instructions. Also, the VirtualBox provided

      <title>Example</title>

      <para>This example shows a simple use case of the Java API. Differences
      for SOAP vs. local version are minimal, and limited to the connection
      setup phase (see <computeroutput>ws</computeroutput> variable). In the
      SOAP case it's possible to create several VirtualBoxManager instances to
      communicate with multiple VirtualBox hosts. <programlisting>
          import org.virtualbox_4_3.*;
          ....
          VirtualBoxManager mgr = VirtualBoxManager.createInstance(null);
          boolean ws = false; // or true, if we need the SOAP version
          if (ws)
          {
              String url = "http://myhost:18034";
              String user = "test";
              String passwd = "test";
              mgr.connect(url, user, passwd);
          }
          IVirtualBox vbox = mgr.getVBox();
          System.out.println("VirtualBox version: " + vbox.getVersion() + "\n");
          // get first VM name
          String m =  vbox.getMachines().get(0).getName();
          System.out.println("\nAttempting to start VM '" + m + "'");
          // start it
          mgr.startVm(m, null, 7000);

          if (ws)
              mgr.disconnect();

          mgr.cleanup();
        </programlisting> For more a complete example, see
      <computeroutput>TestVBox.java</computeroutput>, shipped with the
      SDK. It contains exception handling and error printing code, which
      is important for reliable larger scale projects.</para>

      <para>It is good practice in long-running API clients to process the
      system events every now and then in the main thread (does not work
      in other threads). As a rule of thumb it makes sense to process them
      every few 100msec to every few seconds). This is done by
      calling<programlisting>
        mgr.waitForEvents(0);
        </programlisting>
      This avoids that a large number of system events accumulate, which can
      need a significant amount of memory, and as they also play a role in
      object cleanup it helps freeing additional memory in a timely manner
      which is used by the API implementation itself. Java's garbage collection
      approach already needs more memory due to the delayed freeing of memory
      used by no longer accessible objects, and not processing the system
      events exacerbates the memory usage. The
      <computeroutput>TestVBox.java</computeroutput> example code sprinkles
      such lines over the code to achieve the desired effect. In multi-threaded
      applications it can be called from the main thread periodically.
      Sometimes it's possible to use the non-zero timeout variant of the
      method, which then waits the specified number of milliseconds for
      events, processing them immediately as they arrive. It achieves better
      runtime behavior than separate sleeping/processing.</para>

    <title>Main API change log</title>

    <para>Generally, VirtualBox will maintain API compatibility within a major
    release; a major release occurs when the first or the second of the three
    version components of VirtualBox change (that is, in the x.y.z scheme, a
    major release is one where x or y change, but not when only z
    changes).</para>

    <para>In other words, updates like those from 2.0.0 to 2.0.2 will not come
    with API breakages.</para>

    <para>Migration between major releases most likely will lead to API
    breakage, so please make sure you updated code accordingly. The OOWS Java
    wrappers enforce that mechanism by putting VirtualBox classes into
    version-specific packages such as
    <computeroutput>org.virtualbox_2_2</computeroutput>. This approach allows
    for connecting to multiple VirtualBox versions simultaneously from the
    same Java application.</para>

    <para>The following sections list incompatible changes that the Main API
    underwent since the original release of this SDK Reference with VirtualBox
    2.0. A change is deemed "incompatible" only if it breaks existing client
    code (e.g. changes in method parameter lists, renamed or removed
    interfaces and similar). In other words, the list does not contain new
    interfaces, methods or attributes or other changes that do not affect
    existing client code.</para>

          Small adjustments to the parameter lists have been made to reduce
          the number of API calls when taking online snapshots (no longer
          needs explicit pausing), and taking a snapshot also returns now
          the snapshot id (useful for finding the right snapshot if there
          are non-unique snapshot names).</para>

          <para>The <link linkend="INetworkAdapter">INetworkAdapter</link>
          interface has been cleaned up. The various methods to activate an
          attachment type have been replaced by the

          setter.</para>
          <para>Additionally each attachment mode now has its own attribute,
          which means that host only networks no longer share the settings with
          bridged interfaces.</para>
          <para>To allow introducing new network attachment implementations
          without making API changes, the concept of a generic network

          <para>This version introduces the guest facilities concept. A guest

          <link linkend="AdditionsFacilityType">AdditionsFacilityType</link>.
          Each facility is member of a
          <link linkend="AdditionsFacilityClass">AdditionsFacilityClass</link>
          and has a current status indicated by
          <link linkend="AdditionsFacilityStatus">AdditionsFacilityStatus</link>,
          together with a timestamp (in ms) of the last status update.</para>

      <title>Incompatible API changes with version 4.0</title>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A new Java glue layer replacing the previous OOWS JAX-WS
          bindings was introduced. The new library allows for uniform code
          targeting both local (COM/XPCOM) and remote (SOAP) transports. Now,
          instead of <computeroutput>IWebsessionManager</computeroutput>, the
          new class <computeroutput>VirtualBoxManager</computeroutput> must be
          used. See <xref linkend="javaapi"/> for details.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The confusingly named and impractical session APIs were
          changed. In existing client code, the following changes need to be
          made:<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Replace any
                <computeroutput>IVirtualBox::openSession(uuidMachine,
                ...)</computeroutput> API call with the machine's
                <link linkend="IMachine__lockMachine">IMachine::lockMachine()</link>
                call and a
                <computeroutput>LockType.Write</computeroutput> argument. The
                functionality is unchanged, but instead of "opening a direct
                session on a machine" all documentation now refers to
                "obtaining a write lock on a machine for the client
                session".</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Similarly, replace any
                <computeroutput>IVirtualBox::openExistingSession(uuidMachine,
                ...)</computeroutput> call with the machine's
                <link linkend="IMachine__lockMachine">IMachine::lockMachine()</link>
                call and a <computeroutput>LockType.Shared</computeroutput>
                argument. Whereas it was previously impossible to connect a
                client session to a running VM process in a race-free manner,
                the new API will atomically either write-lock the machine for
                the current session or establish a remote link to an existing
                session. Existing client code which tried calling both
                <computeroutput>openSession()</computeroutput> and
                <computeroutput>openExistingSession()</computeroutput> can now
                use this one call instead.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Third, replace any
                <computeroutput>IVirtualBox::openRemoteSession(uuidMachine,
                ...)</computeroutput> call with the machine's

      <title>Incompatible API changes with version 3.1</title>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Due to the new flexibility in medium attachments that was
          introduced with version 3.1 (in particular, full flexibility with
          attaching CD/DVD drives to arbitrary controllers), we seized the
          opportunity to rework all interfaces dealing with storage media to
          make the API more flexible as well as logical. The
          <link linkend="IStorageController">IStorageController</link>,
          <link linkend="IMedium">IMedium</link>,
          <link linkend="IMediumAttachment">IMediumAttachment</link> and
          <link linkend="IMachine">IMachine</link> interfaces were
          affected the most. Existing code using them to configure storage and
          media needs to be carefully checked.</para>

          <para>All media (hard disks, floppies and CDs/DVDs) are now
          uniformly handled through the <link linkend="IMedium">IMedium</link>
          interface. The device-specific interfaces
          (<code>IHardDisk</code>, <code>IDVDImage</code>,
          <code>IHostDVDDrive</code>, <code>IFloppyImage</code> and
          <code>IHostFloppyDrive</code>) have been merged into IMedium; CD/DVD
          and floppy media no longer need special treatment. The device type
          of a medium determines in which context it can be used. Some
          functionality was moved to the other storage-related
          interfaces.</para>

          <para><code>IMachine::attachHardDisk</code> and similar methods have
          been renamed and generalized to deal with any type of drive and
          medium.
          <link linkend="IMachine__attachDevice">IMachine::attachDevice()</link>
          is the API method for adding any drive to a storage controller. The
          floppy and DVD/CD drives are no longer handled specially, and that
          means you can have more than one of them. As before, drives can only
          be changed while the VM is powered off. Mounting (or unmounting)
          removable media at runtime is possible with
          <link linkend="IMachine__mountMedium">IMachine::mountMedium()</link>.</para>

          <para>Newly created virtual machines have no storage controllers
          associated with them. Even the IDE Controller needs to be created
          explicitly. The floppy controller is now visible as a separate
          controller, with a new storage bus type. For each storage bus type
          you can query the device types which can be attached, so that it is
          not necessary to hardcode any attachment rules.</para>

          <para>This required matching changes e.g. in the callback interfaces
          (the medium specific change notification was replaced by a generic
          medium change notification) and removing associated enums (e.g.
          <code>DriveState</code>). In many places the incorrect use of the
          plural form "media" was replaced by "medium", to improve
          consistency.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>There were substantial changes related to snapshots, triggered
          by the "branched snapshots" functionality introduced with version

          <computeroutput>IConsole::deleteSnapshot()</computeroutput>.
          IConsole::discardCurrentState and
          IConsole::discardCurrentSnapshotAndState were removed; corresponding
          new functionality is in
          <computeroutput>IConsole::restoreSnapshot()</computeroutput>.
          Also, when <computeroutput>IConsole::takeSnapshot()</computeroutput>
          is called on a running virtual machine, a live snapshot will be

          <para>In the object-oriented web service bindings for JAX-WS, proper

          should be treated as opaque unique handles. This change mostly
