    <p>
      <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> version numbers consist of three numbers separated by
      dots where the first and second number represent the major version
      and the third number the minor version. Minor version numbers of
      official releases are always even. An odd minor version number
      represents an internal development or test build. In addition, each
      build contains a revision number.
