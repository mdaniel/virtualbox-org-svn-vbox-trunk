  <title>Known Issues</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>The following section describes known problems with this release of <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. Unless marked otherwise, these issues are planned to be fixed
      in later releases. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The macOS installer packages for <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> 7 currently do not
          include the Internal Networking feature, which is available on all other platforms. This will be addressed
          with an update of <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> 7. For setups which depend on this
          functionality it is best to keep using <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> 6.1. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Poor performance when using <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> and <b outputclass="bold"
            >Hyper-V</b> on the same host. To fix this, certain Windows features like "Hyper-V Platform", "Virtual
          Machine Platform" and "Windows Hypervisor Platform" must be turned off, followed by a host reboot. </p>
        <p>On newer Windows versions, enabling the device security features Core Isolation or Memory Integrity will use Hyper-V, even if you had previously turned it off.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the Microsoft Device Guard and Credential Guard hardware readiness tool might have to be used
          in order to turn off more features. For example, by running the following command: </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">.\DG_Readiness_Tool_vX.X.ps1 -Disable -AutoReboot</pre>
        <note>
          <p>Disabling Device Guard and Credential Guard features will have an impact on the overall security of the
            host. Please contact your Administrator beforehand regarding this. </p>
        </note>

          The following <b outputclass="bold">Guest SMP (multiprocessor)

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">Poor performance</b> with
              32-bit guests on AMD CPUs. This affects mainly Windows and
              Oracle Solaris guests, but possibly also some Linux kernel
              revisions. Partially solved for 32-bit Windows NT, 2000,
              XP, and 2003 guests. Requires the Guest Additions to be
              installed.

          <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">Poor performance</b> with
              32-bit guests on certain Intel CPU models that do not
              include virtual APIC hardware optimization support. This
              affects mainly Windows and Oracle Solaris guests, but
              possibly also some Linux kernel revisions. Partially
              solved for 32-bit Windows NT, 2000, XP, and 2003 guests.

          running is currently logged in and has a desktop session.
        </p>
        <p>Also, to use accounts without or with an empty password, the guest's group policy must be changed. To do so,
          open the group policy editor on the command line by typing <userinput>gpedit.msc</userinput>, open the key
            <codeph>Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options</codeph>

          implemented for VDI files. At the moment the only way to
          optimize the size of a virtual disk images in other formats,
          such as VMDK or VHD, is to clone the image and then use the
          cloned image in the VM configuration.

            <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> does not provide Guest Additions for Mac OS X at
              this time. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The graphics resolution currently defaults to 1024x768 as Mac OS X falls back to the built-in EFI display
              support. See <xref href="efividmode.dita">Video Modes in EFI</xref> for more information on how to change
              EFI video modes. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Mac OS X guests only work with one CPU assigned to the VM. Support for SMP will be provided in a future

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Depending on your system and version of Mac OS X, you might experience guest hangs after some time. This
              can be fixed by turning off energy saving. Set the timeout to "Never" in the system preferences. </p>

          <li>
            <p>By default, the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> EFI enables debug output of the Mac
              OS X kernel to help you diagnose boot problems. Note that there is a lot of output and not all errors are
              fatal. They would also show when using a physical Apple Macintosh computer. You can turn off these
              messages by using the following command: </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">$ VBoxManage setextradata <varname>VM-name</varname> "VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs" "  "</pre>
            <p>
              To revert to the previous behavior, use the following
              command:
            </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">$ VBoxManage setextradata <varname>VM-name</varname> "VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs" ""</pre>

            <p>It is currently not possible to start a Mac OS X guest in safe mode by specifying the <codeph>-x</codeph>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>USB support on Oracle Solaris hosts requires Oracle Solaris 11 FCS or later. Webcams and other isochronous devices are known to have poor performance. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Host Webcam passthrough is restricted to 640x480 frames at 20 frames per second due to limitations in the
              Oracle Solaris V4L2 API. This may be addressed in a future Oracle Solaris release. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>No ACPI information, such as battery status or power source, is reported to the guest. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>No support for using wireless adapters with bridged networking. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Crossbow-based bridged networking on Oracle Solaris 11 hosts does not work directly with aggregate links. However, you can use <userinput>dladm</userinput> to manually create a VNIC over the aggregate link and use that with a VM. This limitation does not exist in Oracle Solaris 11 update 1 (11.1) and later. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Neither virtio nor Intel PRO/1000 drivers for <b outputclass="bold">Windows XP guests</b> support
          segmentation offloading. Therefore Windows XP guests have slower transmission rates comparing to other guest
          types. Refer to MS Knowledge base article 842264 for additional information. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Guest Additions for OS/2.</b>
          Seamless windows and automatic guest resizing will probably
          never be implemented due to inherent limitations of the OS/2
          graphics system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Some guest operating systems predating ATAPI CD-ROMs may exhibit long delays or entirely fail to boot in
          certain configurations. This is most likely to happen when an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM exists alone on a primary or
          secondary IDE channel. </p>
        <p>Affected operating systems are MS OS/2 1.21: fails to boot with an error message referencing COUNTRY.SYS and
          MS OS/2 1.3: long boot delays. To avoid such problems, disable the emulated IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM. The guest OS
          cannot use this device, anyway. </p>
