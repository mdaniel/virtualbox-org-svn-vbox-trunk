  <body>
    <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> comes with comprehensive support for third-party
      developers. The so-called <i>Main API</i> of <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> exposes the
      entire feature set of the virtualization engine. It is completely documented and available to anyone who wants to
      control <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> programmatically. </p>
    <p>The Main API is made available to C++ clients through COM on Windows hosts or XPCOM on other hosts. Bridges also
      exist for SOAP, Java and Python. </p>
    <p>All programming information such as documentation, reference information, header and other interface files, as
      well as samples have been split out to a separate <b outputclass="bold">Software Development Kit (SDK)</b>. The
      SDK is available for download from <ph>http://www.virtualbox.org</ph>. In particular, the SDK comes with a
      Programming Guide and Reference manual in PDF format. This manual contains, among other things, the information
      that was previously in this chapter of the User Guide. </p>
