  <title>Uninstalling the Linux Guest Additions</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>If you have a version of the Guest Additions installed on your virtual machine and want to remove it without
      installing new ones, you can do so by inserting the Guest Additions CD image into the virtual CD-ROM drive as
      described above. Then run the installer for the current Guest Additions with the <codeph>uninstall</codeph>
      parameter from the path that the CD image is mounted on in the guest, as follows: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run uninstall</pre>
    <p>While this will normally work without issues, you may need to do some manual cleanup of the guest in some cases,
      especially of the XFree86Config or xorg.conf file. In particular, if the Additions version installed or the guest
      operating system were very old, or if you made your own changes to the Guest Additions setup after you installed
      them. </p>
    <p>You can uninstall the Additions as follows: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">/opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-<varname>version</varname>/uninstall.sh</pre>
    <p>Replace <filepath>/opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-<varname>version</varname></filepath> with the correct Guest Additions
      installation directory. </p>
