  <title>Updating the Linux Guest Additions</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>The Guest Additions can simply be updated by going through the installation procedure again with an updated
      CD-ROM image. This will replace the drivers with updated versions. You should reboot after updating the Guest
      Additions. </p>
