  <title>Guest Additions for OS/2</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
      <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> also ships with a set of drivers that improve running OS/2 in a virtual machine. Due to restrictions of OS/2 itself, this variant of the Guest Additions has a limited feature set. Specifically, seamless windows and automatic guest resizing are not implemented in Guest Additions for OS/2 because of inherent limitations of the OS/2 graphics system.</p>
    <p>
        The OS/2 Guest Additions are provided on the same ISO CD-ROM as
        those for the other platforms. Mount the ISO in OS/2 as
        described previously. The OS/2 Guest Additions are located in
        the directory <filepath>\OS2</filepath>.
      </p>
    <p>
        We do not provide an automatic installer at this time. See the
        <filepath>readme.txt</filepath> file in the CD-ROM directory,
        which describes how to install the OS/2 Guest Additions
        manually.
