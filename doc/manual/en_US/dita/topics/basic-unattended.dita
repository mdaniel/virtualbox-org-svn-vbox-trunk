  <body>
    <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> can install a guest OS automatically. You only need to
      provide the installation medium and a few other parameters, such as the name of the default user. </p>
    <p>You can perform an unattended guest installation in the following ways: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Use the Create Virtual Machine
          wizard.</b> An optional step in the wizard enables you
          to configure unattended installation. You can specify the
          default user credentials for the guest OS and also whether to
          install the Guest Additions automatically. See
          <xref href="create-vm-wizard.dita#create-vm-wizard"/>.
        </p>
        <p>During this step, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> scans the installation medium and
          changes certain parameters to ensure a seamless installation as a guest running on <ph
            conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Use the <userinput>VBoxManage</userinput>
          commands.</b><xref href="unattended-guest-install-example.dita#unattended-guest-install-example"/> describes
          how to perform an unattended guest installation for an Oracle
          Linux guest.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you first start a VM that has been configured for unattended installation, the guest OS installation is
      performed automatically. </p>
    <p>The installation operation changes the boot device order to boot the virtual hard disk first and then the virtual
      DVD drive. If the virtual hard disk is empty prior to the automatic installation, the VM boots from the virtual
      DVD drive and begins the installation. </p>
    <p>If the virtual hard disk contains a bootable OS, the installation operation exits. In this case, change the boot
      device order manually by pressing F12 during the BIOS splash screen. </p>
