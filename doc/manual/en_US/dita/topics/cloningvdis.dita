  <title>Cloning Disk Images</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>You can duplicate hard disk image files on the same host to quickly produce a second virtual machine with the
      same OS setup. However, you should <i>only</i> make copies of virtual disk images using the utility supplied with
        <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. See <xref href="vboxmanage-clonemedium.dita"/>. This is
      because <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> assigns a UUID to each disk image, which is also
      stored inside the image, and <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> will refuse to work with two
      images that use the same number. If you do accidentally try to reimport a disk image which you copied normally,
      you can make a second copy using the <userinput>VBoxManage clonevm</userinput> command and import that instead. </p>
    <p>Note that Linux distributions identify the boot hard disk from the ID of the drive. The ID <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> reports for a drive is determined from the UUID of the virtual
      disk image. So if you clone a disk image and try to boot the copied image the guest might not be able to determine
      its own boot disk as the UUID changed. In this case you have to adapt the disk ID in your boot loader script, for
      example <filepath>/boot/grub/menu.lst</filepath>. The disk ID looks like the following: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">scsi-SATA_VBOX_HARDDISK_VB5cfdb1e2-c251e503</pre>
    <p>The ID for the copied image can be determined as follows: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">hdparm -i /dev/sda</pre>
