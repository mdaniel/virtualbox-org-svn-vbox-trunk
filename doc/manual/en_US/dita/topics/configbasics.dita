  <title>Virtual Machine Configuration</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>When you select a virtual machine from the list in the VirtualBox Manager window, you will see a summary of that
      machine's settings on the right. </p>
    <p>Clicking on <b outputclass="bold">Settings</b> displays a window, where you can configure many of the properties
      of the selected VM. But be careful when changing VM settings. It is possible to change all VM settings after
      installing a guest OS, but certain changes might prevent a guest OS from functioning correctly if done after
      installation. </p>
    <note>
      <p>The <b outputclass="bold">Settings</b> button is disabled while a VM is either in the Running or Saved state.
        This is because the <b outputclass="bold">Settings</b> window enables you to change fundamental characteristics
        of the virtual machine that is created for your guest OS. For example, the guest OS may not perform well if half
        of its memory is taken away. As a result, if the <b outputclass="bold">Settings</b> button is disabled, shut
        down the current VM first. </p>
    </note>
    <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> provides a wide range of parameters that can be changed for
      a virtual machine. The various settings that can be changed in the <b outputclass="bold">Settings</b> window are
      described in detail in <xref href="BasicConcepts.dita#BasicConcepts"/>. Even more parameters are available when
      using the <userinput>VBoxManage</userinput> command line interface. See <xref href="vboxmanage.dita#vboxmanage"/>. </p>
