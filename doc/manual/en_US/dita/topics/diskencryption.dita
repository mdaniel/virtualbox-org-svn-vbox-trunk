  <title>Encryption of Disk Images</title>
  
  <body>
    <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> enables you to transparently encrypt the data stored in
      hard disk images for the guest. It does not depend on a specific image format to be used. Images which have the
      data encrypted are not portable between <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> and other
      virtualization software. </p>
    <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> uses the AES algorithm in XTS mode and supports 128-bit or
      256-bit data encryption keys (DEK). The DEK is stored encrypted in the medium properties and is decrypted during
      VM startup by entering a password which was chosen when the image was encrypted. </p>
    <p>Since the DEK is stored as part of the VM configuration file, it is important that it is kept safe. Losing the
      DEK means that the data stored in the disk images is lost irrecoverably. Having complete and up-to-date backups of
      all data related to the VM is the responsibility of the user. </p>
