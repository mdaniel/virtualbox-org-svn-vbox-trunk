  <glossdef>
    Remote Desktop Protocol, a protocol developed by Microsoft as an
    extension to the ITU T.128 and T.124 video conferencing protocol.
    With RDP, a PC system can be controlled from a remote location
    using a network connection over which data is transferred in
    both directions. Typically graphics updates and audio are sent
    from the remote machine and keyboard and mouse input events are
        sent from the client. An <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> extension package by 
    Oracle provides VRDP, an enhanced implementation of the relevant
    standards which is largely compatible with Microsoft's RDP
    implementation.
    See <xref href="remotevm.dita">Remote Display (VRDP Support)</xref> for details.
