  <title>Supported Formats</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>As <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> can run on a variety of host operating systems and also
      supports a wide range of guests, certain data formats must be translated after transfer. This is so that the
      destination operating system, which receives the data, is able to handle them in an appropriate manner. </p>
    <note>
      <p>When dragging files no data conversion is done in any way. For example, when transferring a file from a Linux
        guest to a Windows host the Linux-specific line endings are not converted to Windows line endings. </p>
    </note>
    <p>The following formats are handled by the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> drag and drop
      service: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Plain text:</b> From
            applications such as text editors, internet browsers and
            terminal windows.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Files:</b> From file managers
            such as Windows Explorer, Nautilus, and Finder.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Directories:</b> For
            directories, the same formats apply as for files.
          </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
