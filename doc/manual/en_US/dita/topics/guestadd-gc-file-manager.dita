  <title>Guest Control File Manager</title>
  <body>
    <p>If you have Guest Additions installed, you can use the Guest Control File Manager to copy files between a virtual
      machine (VM) and the host system. You can also create new folders, rename files and delete files. </p>
    <p>This feature is useful when the VM window of a guest is not visible. For example, when the guest is running in
      headless mode. </p>
    <note>
      <p>To use the Guest Control File Manager, the guest must be running. For powered-off guests, it is disabled
        automatically. </p>
