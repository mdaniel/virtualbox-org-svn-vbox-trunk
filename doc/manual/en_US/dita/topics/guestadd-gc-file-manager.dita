  <title>Guest Control File Manager</title>
  <!-- 7.1: new icons added, pic removed-->
  <body>
    <p>The Guest Control File Manager is a feature of the Guest Additions that enables easy copying and moving of files
      between a guest and the host system. Other file management operations provide support to create new folders and to
      rename or delete files. </p>
    <p>This feature is useful when the VM window of a guest is not visible. For example, when the guest is running in
      headless mode. </p>
    <note>
      <p>To use the Guest Control File Manager, the guest must be running. For powered-off guests, it is disabled
        automatically. </p>
