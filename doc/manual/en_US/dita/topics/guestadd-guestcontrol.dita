  <title>Guest Control of Applications</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
      The Guest Additions enable starting of applications inside a guest
      VM from the host system. This feature can be used to automate
      deployment of software within the guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this to work, the application needs to be installed on the
      guest. No additional software needs to be installed on the host.
      Additionally, text mode output to stdout and stderr can be shown
      on the host for further processing. There are options to specify
      user credentials and a timeout value, in milliseconds, to limit
      the time the application is able to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Guest Additions for Windows allow for automatic updating. This
      applies for already installed Guest Additions versions. Also,
      copying files from host to the guest as well as remotely creating
      guest directories is available.
    </p>
    <p> To use these features, use the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> command line. See <xref href="../cli_topics/vboxmanage-guestcontrol.dita"/>. </p>
