  <title>Guest Graphics and Mouse Driver Setup in Depth</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>This section assumes that you are familiar with configuring the X.Org server using xorg.conf and optionally the
      newer mechanisms using hal or udev and xorg.conf.d. If not you can learn about them by studying the documentation
      which comes with X.Org. </p>
    <p>The <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> Guest Additions includes drivers for X.Org. By default
      these drivers are in the following directory: </p>
    <p><filepath>/opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-<varname>version</varname>/other/</filepath>
      </p>
    <p>The correct versions for the X server are symbolically linked into the X.Org driver directories. </p>
    <p>For graphics integration to work correctly, the X server must load the <codeph>vboxvideo</codeph> driver. Many
      recent X server versions look for it automatically if they see that they are running in <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. For an optimal user experience, the guest kernel drivers must
      be loaded and the Guest Additions tool <userinput>VBoxClient</userinput> must be running as a client in the X
      session. </p>
    <p>For mouse integration to work correctly, the guest kernel drivers must be loaded. In addition, for legacy X
      servers the correct <codeph>vboxmouse</codeph> driver must be loaded and associated with
        <filepath>/dev/mouse</filepath> or <filepath>/dev/psaux</filepath>. For most guests, a driver for a PS/2 mouse
      must be loaded and the correct vboxmouse driver must be associated with <filepath>/dev/vboxguest</filepath>. </p>
    <p>The <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> guest graphics driver can use any graphics
      configuration for which the virtual resolution fits into the virtual video memory allocated to the virtual
      machine, minus a small amount used by the guest driver, as described in <xref href="settings-display.dita">Display
        Settings</xref>. The driver will offer a range of standard modes at least up to the default guest resolution for
      all active guest monitors. The default mode can be changed by setting the output property VBOX_MODE to
      "&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;" for any guest monitor. When VBoxClient and the kernel drivers are active this is
      done automatically when the host requests a mode change. The driver for older versions can only receive new modes
      by querying the host for requests at regular intervals. </p>
    <p>With legacy X Servers before version 1.3, you can also add your own modes to the X server configuration file. Add
      them to the "Modes" list in the "Display" subsection of the "Screen" section. For example, the following section
      has a custom 2048x800 resolution mode added: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">Section "Screen"
        Identifier    "Default Screen"
        Device        "VirtualBox graphics card"
        Monitor       "Generic Monitor"
        DefaultDepth  24
        SubSection "Display"
                Depth         24
                Modes         "2048x800" "800x600" "640x480"
        EndSubSection
EndSection</pre>
