  <title>Support for Keyboard Indicator Synchronization</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>This feature makes the host keyboard indicators (LEDs) match those of the VM's emulated keyboard when the machine
      window is active. It is currently implemented for macOS and Windows hosts. This feature is enabled by default on
      supported host OSes. You can disable this feature by running the following command: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">$ VBoxManage setextradata <varname>VM-name</varname> GUI/HidLedsSync 0</pre>
    <p>This is a per-VM setting that is enabled by default. </p>
