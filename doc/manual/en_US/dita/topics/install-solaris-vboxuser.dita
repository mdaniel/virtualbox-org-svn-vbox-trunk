  <title>The vboxuser Group</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>The installer creates the system user group <codeph>vboxuser</codeph> during installation for Oracle Solaris
      hosts that support the USB features required by <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. Any system
      user who is going to use USB devices from <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> guests must be a
      member of this group. A user can be made a member of this group either by using the desktop user and group tools
      or by running the following command as root: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">usermod -G vboxuser username</pre>
    <p>Note that adding an active user to the <codeph>vboxuser</codeph> group will require the user to log out and then
      log in again. This should be done manually after successful installation of the package. </p>
