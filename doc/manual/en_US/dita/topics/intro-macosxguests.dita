  <title>Mac OS X Guests</title>
  
  <body>
    <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> enables you to install and execute unmodified versions of
      Mac OS X guests on supported host hardware. Note that this feature is experimental and thus unsupported. </p>
    <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> is the first product to provide the modern PC architecture
      expected by OS X without requiring any of the modifications used by competing virtualization solutions. For
      example, some competing solutions perform modifications to the Mac OS X install DVDs, such as a different boot
      loader and replaced files. </p>
    <p>Be aware of the following important issues before you attempt to install a Mac OS X guest: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Mac OS X is commercial, licensed software and contains <b outputclass="bold">both license and technical
            restrictions</b> that limit its use to certain hardware and usage scenarios. You must understand and comply
          with these restrictions. </p>
        <p>In particular, Apple prohibits the installation of most versions of Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware. </p>
        <p>These license restrictions are also enforced on a technical level. Mac OS X verifies that it is running on
          Apple hardware. Most DVDs that accompany Apple hardware check for the exact model. These restrictions are
            <i>not</i> circumvented by <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> and continue to apply. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Only <b outputclass="bold">CPUs</b> that are known and tested by Apple are supported. As a result, if your
          Intel CPU is newer than the Mac OS X build, or if you have a non-Intel CPU, you will likely encounter a panic
          during bootup with an "Unsupported CPU" exception. </p>
        <p>Ensure that you use the Mac OS X DVD that comes with your Apple hardware. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Mac OS X installer expects the hard disk to be <i>partitioned</i>. So, the installer will not offer a
          partition selection to you. Before you can install the software successfully, start the Disk Utility from the
          Tools menu and partition the hard disk. Close the Disk Utility and proceed with the installation. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In addition, Mac OS X support in <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> is an experimental
          feature. See <xref href="KnownIssues.dita">Known Limitations</xref>. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
