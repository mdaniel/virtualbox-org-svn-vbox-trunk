  <title>Changing Removable Media</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>While a virtual machine is running, you can change removable media in the <b outputclass="bold">Devices</b> menu
      of the VM's window. Here you can select in detail what <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>
      presents to your VM as a CD, DVD, or floppy drive. </p>
    <p>The settings are the same as those available for the VM in the <b outputclass="bold">Settings</b> window of <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/vbox-mgr"/>. But as the <b outputclass="bold">Settings</b> window is disabled
      while the VM is in the Running or Saved state, the <b outputclass="bold">Devices</b> menu saves you from having to
      shut down and restart the VM every time you want to change media. </p>
    <p>Using the <b outputclass="bold">Devices</b> menu, you can attach the host drive to the guest or select a floppy
      or DVD image, as described in <xref href="settings-storage.dita#settings-storage"/>. </p>
    <p>The <b outputclass="bold">Devices</b> menu also includes an option for creating a virtual ISO (VISO) from
      selected files on the host. </p>
