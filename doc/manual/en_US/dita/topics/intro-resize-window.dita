  <title>Resizing the Machine's Window</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>You can resize the VM's window while that VM is running. When you do, the window is scaled as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If you have <b outputclass="bold">scaled mode</b> enabled, then the virtual machine's screen will be scaled
          to the size of the window. This can be useful if you have many machines running and want to have a look at one
          of them while it is running in the background. Alternatively, it might be useful to enlarge a window if the
          VM's output screen is very small, for example because you are running an old OS in it. </p>
        <p>To enable scaled mode, press <b outputclass="bold">Host key + C</b>, or select <b outputclass="bold">Scaled
            Mode</b> from the <b outputclass="bold">View</b> menu in the VM window. To leave scaled mode, press <b
            outputclass="bold">Host key + C </b>again. </p>
        <p>The aspect ratio of the guest screen is preserved when resizing the window. To ignore the aspect ratio, press
            <b outputclass="bold">Shift</b> during the resize operation. </p>
        <p>See <xref href="KnownIssues.dita">Known Limitations</xref> for additional remarks. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you have the Guest Additions installed and they support automatic <b outputclass="bold">resizing</b>, the
          Guest Additions will automatically adjust the screen resolution of the guest OS. For example, if you are
          running a Windows guest with a resolution of 1024x768 pixels and you then resize the VM window to make it 100
          pixels wider, the Guest Additions will change the Windows display resolution to 1124x768. </p>
        <p>See <xref href="guestadditions.dita"/>. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Otherwise, if the window is bigger than the VM's screen, the screen will be centered. If it is smaller, then
          scroll bars will be added to the machine window. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
