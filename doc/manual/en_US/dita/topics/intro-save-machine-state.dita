  <title>Saving the State of the Machine</title>
  <body>
    <p>When you click the <b outputclass="bold">Close</b> button of your virtual machine window, at the top right of the
      window, just like you would close any other window on your system, <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> asks you whether you want to save or power off the VM. As a
      shortcut, you can also press <b outputclass="bold">Host key + Q</b>. </p>
    <p>
        The difference between the three options is crucial. They mean
        the following:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Save the machine state:</b>
            With this option, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>
            <i>freezes</i> the virtual machine by
            completely saving its state to your local disk.
          </p>
        <p>When you start the VM again later, you will find that the VM continues exactly where it was left off. All
          your programs will still be open, and your computer resumes operation. Saving the state of a virtual machine
          is thus in some ways similar to suspending a laptop computer by closing its lid. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Send the shutdown signal.</b>
            This will send an ACPI shutdown signal to the virtual
            machine, which has the same effect as if you had pressed the
            power button on a real computer. This should trigger a
            proper shutdown mechanism from within the VM.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Power off the machine:</b> With
            this option, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> also stops running the virtual
            machine, but <i>without</i> saving its state.
          </p>
        <note type="caution">
          <p>This is equivalent to pulling the power plug on a real computer without shutting it down properly. If you
            start the machine again after powering it off, your OS will have to reboot completely and may begin a
            lengthy check of its virtual system disks. As a result, this should not normally be done, since it can
            potentially cause data loss or an inconsistent state of the guest system on disk. </p>
        </note>
        <p>As an exception, if your virtual machine has any snapshots, see <xref href="snapshots.dita#snapshots"/>, you
          can use this option to quickly <b outputclass="bold">restore the current snapshot</b> of the virtual machine.
          In that case, powering off the machine will discard the current state and any changes made since the previous
          snapshot was taken will be lost. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <b outputclass="bold">Discard</b> button in the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/vbox-mgr"/> window
      discards a virtual machine's saved state. This has the same effect as powering it off, and the same warnings
      apply. </p>
