cexcept.h 2.0.1 (2008-Jul-19-Sat)
http://www.nicemice.net/cexcept/
Adam M. Costello
http://www.nicemice.net/amc/

An interface for exception-handling in ANSI C (C89 and subsequent ISO
standards), developed jointly with Cosmin Truta.

    Copyright (c) 2000-2008 Adam M. Costello and Cosmin Truta.
    This software may be modified only if its author and version
    information is updated accurately, and may be redistributed
    only if accompanied by this unaltered notice.  Subject to those
    restrictions, permission is granted to anyone to do anything
    with this software.  The copyright holders make no guarantees
    regarding this software, and are not responsible for any damage
    resulting from its use.

The cexcept interface is not compatible with and cannot interact
with system exceptions (like division by zero or memory segmentation
violation), compiler-generated exceptions (like C++ exceptions), or
other exception-handling interfaces.

When using this interface across multiple .c files, do not include
this header file directly.  Instead, create a wrapper header file that
includes this header file and then invokes the define_exception_type
macro (see below).  The .c files should then include that header file.

The interface consists of one type, one well-known name, and six macros.


define_exception_type(type_name);

    This macro is used like an external declaration.  It specifies
    the type of object that gets copied from the exception thrower to
    the exception catcher.  The type_name can be any type that can be
    assigned to, that is, a non-constant arithmetic type, struct, union,
    or pointer.  Examples:

        define_exception_type(int);

        enum exception { out_of_memory, bad_arguments, disk_full };
        define_exception_type(enum exception);

        struct exception { int code; const char *msg; };
        define_exception_type(struct exception);

    Because throwing an exception causes the object to be copied (not
    just once, but twice), programmers may wish to consider size when
    choosing the exception type.


struct exception_context;

    This type may be used after the define_exception_type() macro has
    been invoked.  A struct exception_context must be known to both
    the thrower and the catcher.  It is expected that there be one
    context for each thread that uses exceptions.  It would certainly
    be dangerous for multiple threads to access the same context.
    One thread can use multiple contexts, but that is likely to be
    confusing and not typically useful.  The application can allocate
    this structure in any way it pleases--automatic, static, or dynamic.
    The application programmer should pretend not to know the structure
    members, which are subject to change.


struct exception_context *the_exception_context;

    The Try/Catch and Throw statements (described below) implicitly
    refer to a context, using the name the_exception_context.  It is
    the application&#39;s responsibility to make sure that this name yields
    the address of a mutable (non-constant) struct exception_context
    wherever those statements are used.  Subject to that constraint, the
    application may declare a variable of this name anywhere it likes
    (inside a function, in a parameter list, or externally), and may
    use whatever storage class specifiers (static, extern, etc) or type
    qualifiers (const, volatile, etc) it likes.  Examples:

        static struct exception_context
          * const the_exception_context = &amp;foo;

        { struct exception_context *the_exception_context = bar; ... }

        int blah(struct exception_context *the_exception_context, ...);

        extern struct exception_context the_exception_context[1];

    The last example illustrates a trick that avoids creating a pointer
    object separate from the structure object.

    The name could even be a macro, for example:

        struct exception_context ec_array[numthreads];
        #define the_exception_context (ec_array + thread_id)

    Be aware that the_exception_context is used several times by the
    Try/Catch/Throw macros, so it shouldn&#39;t be expensive or have side
    effects.  The expansion must be a drop-in replacement for an
    identifier, so it&#39;s safest to put parentheses around it.


void init_exception_context(struct exception_context *ec);

    For context structures allocated statically (by an external
    definition or using the &#34;static&#34; keyword), the implicit
    initialization to all zeros is sufficient, but contexts allocated
    by other means must be initialized using this macro before they
    are used by a Try/Catch statement.  It does no harm to initialize
    a context more than once (by using this macro on a statically
    allocated context, or using this macro twice on the same context),
    but a context must not be re-initialized after it has been used by a
    Try/Catch statement.


Try statement
Catch (expression) statement

    The Try/Catch/Throw macros are capitalized in order to avoid
    confusion with the C++ keywords, which have subtly different
    semantics.

    A Try/Catch statement has a syntax similar to an if/else statement,
    except that the parenthesized expression goes after the second
    keyword rather than the first.  As with if/else, there are two
    clauses, each of which may be a simple statement ending with a
    semicolon or a brace-enclosed compound statement.  But whereas
    the else clause is optional, the Catch clause is required.  The
    expression must be a modifiable lvalue (something capable of being
    assigned to) of the same type (disregarding type qualifiers) that
    was passed to define_exception_type().

    If a Throw that uses the same exception context as the Try/Catch is
    executed within the Try clause (typically within a function called
    by the Try clause), and the exception is not caught by a nested
    Try/Catch statement, then a copy of the exception will be assigned
    to the expression, and control will jump to the Catch clause.  If no
    such Throw is executed, then the assignment is not performed, and
    the Catch clause is not executed.

    The expression is not evaluated unless and until the exception is
    caught, which is significant if it has side effects, for example:

        Try foo();
        Catch (p[++i].e) { ... }

    IMPORTANT: Jumping into or out of a Try clause (for example via
    return, break, continue, goto, longjmp) is forbidden--the compiler
    will not complain, but bad things will happen at run-time.  Jumping
    into or out of a Catch clause is okay, and so is jumping around
    inside a Try clause.  In many cases where one is tempted to return
    from a Try clause, it will suffice to use Throw, and then return
    from the Catch clause.  Another option is to set a flag variable and
    use goto to jump to the end of the Try clause, then check the flag
    after the Try/Catch statement.

    IMPORTANT: The values of any non-volatile automatic variables
    changed within the Try clause are undefined after an exception is
    caught.  Therefore, variables modified inside the Try block whose
    values are needed later outside the Try block must either use static
    storage or be declared with the &#34;volatile&#34; type qualifier.


Throw expression;

    A Throw statement is very much like a return statement, except that
    the expression is required.  Whereas return jumps back to the place
    where the current function was called, Throw jumps back to the Catch
    clause of the innermost enclosing Try clause.  The expression must
    be compatible with the type passed to define_exception_type().  The
    exception must be caught, otherwise the program may crash.

    Slight limitation:  If the expression is a comma-expression, it must
    be enclosed in parentheses.


Try statement
Catch_anonymous statement

    When the value of the exception is not needed, a Try/Catch statement
    can use Catch_anonymous instead of Catch (expression).


Everything below this point is for the benefit of the compiler.  The
application programmer should pretend not to know any of it, because it
is subject to change.

 *
 * Make a test PNG image.  The arguments are as follows:
 *
 *    makepng [--sRGB|--linear|--1.8] [--tRNS] [--nofilters] \
 *       color-type bit-depth [file-name]
 *
 * The color-type may be numeric (and must match the numbers used by the PNG
 * specification) or one of the format names listed below.  The bit-depth is the
 * component bit depth, or the pixel bit-depth for a color-mapped image.
 *
 * Without any options no color-space information is written, with the options
 * an sRGB or the appropriate gAMA chunk is written.  &#34;1.8&#34; refers to the
 * display system used on older Apple computers to correct for high ambient
 * light levels in the viewing environment; it applies a transform of
 * approximately value^(1/1.45) to the color values and so a gAMA chunk of 65909
 * is written (1.45/2.2).
 *
 * The image data is generated internally.  Unless --color is given the images
 * used are as follows:
 *
 * 1 channel: a square image with a diamond, the least luminous colors are on
 *    the edge of the image, the most luminous in the center.
 *
 * 2 channels: the color channel increases in luminosity from top to bottom, the
 *    alpha channel increases in opacity from left to right.
 *
 * 3 channels: linear combinations of, from the top-left corner clockwise,
 *    black, green, white, red.
 *
 * 4 channels: linear combinations of, from the top-left corner clockwise,
 *    transparent, red, green, blue.
 *
 * For color-mapped images a four channel color-map is used and if --tRNS is
 * given the PNG file has a tRNS chunk, as follows:
 *
 * 1-bit: entry 0 is transparent-red, entry 1 is opaque-white
 * 2-bit: entry 0: transparent-green
 *        entry 1: 40%-red
 *        entry 2: 80%-blue
 *        entry 3: opaque-white
 * 4-bit: the 16 combinations of the 2-bit case
 * 8-bit: the 256 combinations of the 4-bit case
 *
 * The palette always has 2^bit-depth entries and the tRNS chunk one fewer.  The
 * image is the 1-channel diamond, but using palette index, not luminosity.
 *
 * For formats other than color-mapped ones if --tRNS is specified a tRNS chunk
 * is generated with all channels equal to the low bits of 0x0101.
 *
 * Image size is determined by the final pixel depth in bits, i.e. channels x
 * bit-depth, as follows:
 *
 * 8 bits or less:    64x64
 * 16 bits:           256x256
 * More than 16 bits: 1024x1024
 *
 * Row filtering is the libpng default but may be turned off (the &#39;none&#39; filter
 * is used on every row) with the --nofilters option.
 *
 * The images are not interlaced.
 *
 * If file-name is given then the PNG is written to that file, else it is
 * written to stdout.  Notice that stdout is not supported on systems where, by
 * default, it assumes text output; this program makes no attempt to change the
 * text mode of stdout!
 *
 *    makepng --color=&lt;color&gt; ...
 *
 * If --color is given then the whole image has that color, color-mapped images
 * will have exactly one palette entry and all image files with be 16x16 in
 * size.  The color value is 1 to 4 decimal numbers as appropriate for the color
 * type.
 *
 *    makepng --small ...
 *
 * If --small is given the images are no larger than required to include every
 * possible pixel value for the format.
 *
 * For formats with pixels 8 bits or fewer in size the images consist of a
 * single row with 2^pixel-depth pixels, one of every possible value.
 *
 * For formats with 16-bit pixels a 256x256 image is generated containing every
 * possible pixel value.
 *
 * For larger pixel sizes a 256x256 image is generated where the first row
 * consists of each pixel that has identical byte values throughout the pixel
 * followed by rows where the byte values differ within the pixel.
 *
 * In all cases the pixel values are arranged in such a way that the SUB and UP
 * filters give byte sequences for maximal zlib compression.  By default (if
 * --nofilters is not given) the SUB filter is used on the first row and the UP
 * filter on all following rows.
 *
 * The --small option is meant to provide good test-case coverage, however the
 * images are not easy to examine visually.  Without the --small option the
 * images contain identical color values; the pixel values are adjusted
 * according to the gamma encoding with no gamma encoding being interpreted as
 * sRGB.

contrib/gregbook/rpng2-win.c

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   rpng2 - progressive-model PNG display program                rpng2-win.c

   This program decodes and displays PNG files progressively, as if it were
   a web browser (though the front end is only set up to read from files).
   It supports gamma correction, user-specified background colors, and user-
   specified background patterns (for transparent images).  This version is
   for 32-bit Windows; it may compile under 16-bit Windows with a little
   tweaking (or maybe not).  Thanks to Adam Costello and Pieter S. van der
   Meulen for the &#34;diamond&#34; and &#34;radial waves&#34; patterns, respectively.

   to do (someday, maybe):
    - handle quoted command-line args (especially filenames with spaces)
    - finish resizable checkerboard-gradient (sizes 4-128?)
    - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?
    - have minimum window width:  oh well

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Changelog:
    - 1.01:  initial public release
    - 1.02:  fixed cut-and-paste error in usage screen (oops...)
    - 1.03:  modified to allow abbreviated options
    - 1.04:  removed bogus extra argument from usage fprintf() [Glenn R-P?];
              fixed command-line parsing bug
    - 1.10:  enabled &#34;message window&#34;/console (thanks to David Geldreich)
    - 1.20:  added runtime MMX-enabling/disabling and new -mmx* options
    - 1.21:  made minor tweak to usage screen to fit within 25-line console
    - 1.22:  added AMD64/EM64T support (__x86_64__)
    - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
    - 2.01:  fixed 64-bit typo in readpng2.c
    - 2.02:  fixed improper display of usage screen on PNG error(s); fixed
              unexpected-EOF and file-read-error cases
    - 2.03:  removed runtime MMX-enabling/disabling and obsolete -mmx* options
    - 2.04:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

#
# The default options also support &#39;--debug&#39;, which will turn on shell

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   rpng - simple PNG display program                             rpng-win.c

   This program decodes and displays PNG images, with gamma correction and
   optionally with a user-specified background color (in case the image has
   transparency).  It is very nearly the most basic PNG viewer possible.
   This version is for 32-bit Windows; it may compile under 16-bit Windows
   with a little tweaking (or maybe not).

   to do:
    - handle quoted command-line args (especially filenames with spaces)
    - have minimum window width:  oh well
    - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Changelog:
    - 1.00:  initial public release
    - 1.01:  modified to allow abbreviated options; fixed long/ulong mis-
              match; switched to png_jmpbuf() macro
    - 1.02:  added extra set of parentheses to png_jmpbuf() macro; fixed
              command-line parsing bug
    - 1.10:  enabled &#34;message window&#34;/console (thanks to David Geldreich)
    - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
    - 2.01:  fixed improper display of usage screen on PNG error(s)
    - 2.02:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

 *
 * This program reads in a PNG image, writes it out again, and then
 * compares the two files.  If the files are identical, this shows that
 * the basic chunk handling, filtering, and (de)compression code is working
 * properly.  It does not currently test all of the transforms, although
 * it probably should.
 *
 * The program will report &#34;FAIL&#34; in certain legitimate cases:
 * 1) when the compression level or filter selection method is changed.
 * 2) when the maximum IDAT size (PNG_ZBUF_SIZE in pngconf.h) is not 8192.
 * 3) unknown unsafe-to-copy ancillary chunks or unknown critical chunks
 *    exist in the input file.
 * 4) others not listed here...
 * In these cases, it is best to check with another tool such as &#34;pngcheck&#34;
 * to see what the differences between the two files are.
 *
 * If a filename is given on the command-line, then this file is used
 * for the input, rather than the default &#34;pngtest.png&#34;.  This allows
 * testing a wide variety of files easily.  You can also test a number
 * of files at once by typing &#34;pngtest -m file1.png file2.png ...&#34;

/* With all write APIs if image is in one of the linear formats with 16-bit
 * data then setting convert_to_8_bit will cause the output to be an 8-bit PNG
 * gamma encoded according to the sRGB specification, otherwise a 16-bit linear
 * encoded PNG file is written.
 *
 * With color-mapped data formats the colormap parameter point to a color-map
 * with at least image-&gt;colormap_entries encoded in the specified format.  If
 * the format is linear the written PNG color-map will be converted to sRGB
 * regardless of the convert_to_8_bit flag.
 *
 * With all APIs row_stride is handled as in the read APIs - it is the spacing
 * from one row to the next in component sized units (1 or 2 bytes) and if
 * negative indicates a bottom-up row layout in the buffer.  If row_stride is
 * zero, libpng will calculate it for you from the image width and number of
 * channels.
 *
 * Note that the write API does not support interlacing, sub-8-bit pixels or
 * most ancillary chunks.  If you need to write text chunks (e.g. for copyright
 * notices) you need to use one of the other APIs.

   rpng2 - progressive-model PNG display program                  rpng2-x.c

   This program decodes and displays PNG files progressively, as if it were
   a web browser (though the front end is only set up to read from files).
   It supports gamma correction, user-specified background colors, and user-
   specified background patterns (for transparent images).  This version is
   for the X Window System (tested by the author under Unix and by Martin
   Zinser under OpenVMS; may work under OS/2 with a little tweaking).

   Thanks to Adam Costello and Pieter S. van der Meulen for the &#34;diamond&#34;
   and &#34;radial waves&#34; patterns, respectively.

   to do (someday, maybe):
    - fix expose/redraw code:  don&#39;t draw entire row if only part exposed
    - 8-bit (colormapped) X support
    - finish resizable checkerboard-gradient (sizes 4-128?)
    - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Read several PNG files, which should have an alpha channel or transparency
 * information, and composite them together to produce one or more 16-bit linear
 * RGBA intermediates.  This involves doing the correct &#39;over&#39; composition to
 * combine the alpha channels and corresponding data.
 *
 * Finally read an output (background) PNG using the 24-bit RGB format (the
 * PNG will be composited on green (#00ff00) by default if it has an alpha
 * channel), and apply the intermediate image generated above to specified
 * locations in the image.
 *
 * The command line has the general format:
 *
 *    simpleover &lt;background.png&gt; [output.png]
 *        {--sprite=width,height,name {[--at=x,y] {sprite.png}}}
 *        {--add=name {x,y}}
 *
 * The --sprite and --add options may occur multiple times. They are executed
 * in order.  --add may refer to any sprite already read.
 *
 * This code is intended to show how to composite multiple images together
 * correctly.  Apart from the libpng Simplified API the only work done in here
 * is to combine multiple input PNG images into a single sprite; this involves
 * a Porter-Duff &#39;over&#39; operation and the input PNG images may, as a result,
 * be regarded as being layered one on top of the other with the first (leftmost
 * on the command line) being at the bottom and the last on the top.

 * United States.
 *
 * Generate a PNG with an alpha channel, correctly.
 *
 * This is a test case generator; the resultant PNG files are only of interest
 * to those of us who care about whether the edges of circles are green, red,
 * or yellow.
 *
 * The program generates an RGB+Alpha PNG of a given size containing the given
 * shapes on a transparent background:
 *
 *  genpng width height { shape }
 *    shape ::= color width shape x1 y1 x2 y2
 *
 * &#39;color&#39; is:
 *
 *  black white red green yellow blue brown purple pink orange gray cyan
 *
 * The point is to have colors that are linguistically meaningful plus that old
 * bugbear of the department store dress murders, Cyan, the only color we argue
 * about.
 *
 * &#39;shape&#39; is:
 *
 *  circle: an ellipse
 *  square: a rectangle
 *  line: a straight line
 *
 * Each shape is followed by four numbers, these are two points in the output
 * coordinate space (as real numbers) which describe the circle, square, or
 * line.  The shape is filled if it is preceded by &#39;filled&#39; (not valid for
 * &#39;line&#39;) or is drawn with a line, in which case the width of the line must
 * precede the shape.
 *
 * The whole set of information can be repeated as many times as desired:
 *
 *    shape ::= color width shape x1 y1 x2 y2
 *
 *    color ::= black|white|red|green|yellow|blue
 *    color ::= brown|purple|pink|orange|gray|cyan
 *    width ::= filled
 *    width ::= &lt;number&gt;
 *    shape ::= circle|square|line
 *    x1    ::= &lt;number&gt;
 *    x2    ::= &lt;number&gt;
 *    y1    ::= &lt;number&gt;
 *    y2    ::= &lt;number&gt;
 *
 * The output PNG is generated by down-sampling a 4x supersampled image using
 * a bi-cubic filter.  The bi-cubic has a 2 (output) pixel width, so an 8x8
 * array of super-sampled points contribute to each output pixel.  The value of
 * a super-sampled point is found using an unfiltered, aliased, infinite
 * precision image: Each shape from the last to the first is checked to see if
 * the point is in the drawn area and, if it is, the color of the point is the
 * color of the shape and the alpha is 1, if not the previous shape is checked.
 *
 * This is an aliased algorithm because no filtering is done; a point is either
 * inside or outside each shape and &#39;close&#39; points do not contribute to the
 * sample.  The down-sampling is relied on to correct the error of not using
 * a filter.
 *
 * The line end-caps are &#39;flat&#39;; they go through the points.  The square line
 * joins are mitres; the outside of the lines are continued to the point of
 * intersection.

   wpng - simple PNG-writing program                                 wpng.c

   This program converts certain NetPBM binary files (grayscale and RGB,
   maxval = 255) to PNG.  Non-interlaced PNGs are written progressively;
   interlaced PNGs are read and written in one memory-intensive blast.

   Thanks to Jean-loup Gailly for providing the necessary trick to read
   interactive text from the keyboard while stdin is redirected.  Thanks
   to Cosmin Truta for Cygwin fixes.

   NOTE:  includes provisional support for PNM type &#34;8&#34; (portable alphamap)
          images, presumed to be a 32-bit interleaved RGBA format; no pro-
          vision for possible interleaved grayscale+alpha (16-bit) format.
          THIS IS UNLIKELY TO BECOME AN OFFICIAL NETPBM ALPHA FORMAT!

   to do:
    - delete output file if quit before calling any writepng routines
    - process backspace with -text option under DOS/Win? (currently get ^H)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Changelog:
    - 1.01:  initial public release
    - 1.02:  modified to allow abbreviated options
    - 1.03:  removed extraneous character from usage screen; fixed bug in
              command-line parsing
    - 1.04:  fixed DOS/OS2/Win32 detection, including partial Cygwin fix
              (see http://home.att.net/~perlspinr/diffs/GregBook_cygwin.diff)
    - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
    - 2.01:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

        [REPORTED BUG (win32 only):  &#34;contrib/gregbook/wpng.c - cmd line
         dose not work!  In order to do something useful I needed to redirect
         both input and output, with cygwin and with bcc32 as well.  Under
         Linux, the same wpng appears to work fine.  I don&#39;t know what is
         the problem.&#34;]

   rpng - simple PNG display program                               rpng-x.c

   This program decodes and displays PNG images, with gamma correction and
   optionally with a user-specified background color (in case the image has
   transparency).  It is very nearly the most basic PNG viewer possible.
   This version is for the X Window System (tested by author under Unix and
   by Martin Zinser under OpenVMS; may work under OS/2 with some tweaking).

   to do:
    - 8-bit (colormapped) X support
    - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Changelog:
    - 1.01:  initial public release
    - 1.02:  modified to allow abbreviated options; fixed long/ulong mis-
              match; switched to png_jmpbuf() macro
    - 1.10:  added support for non-default visuals; fixed X pixel-conversion
    - 1.11:  added extra set of parentheses to png_jmpbuf() macro; fixed
              command-line parsing bug
    - 1.12:  fixed some small X memory leaks (thanks to Fran�ois Petitjean)
    - 1.13:  fixed XFreeGC() crash bug (thanks to Patrick Welche)
    - 1.14:  added support for X resources (thanks to Gerhard Niklasch)
    - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
    - 2.01:  fixed improper display of usage screen on PNG error(s)
    - 2.02:  Added &#34;void(argc);&#34; statement to quiet pedantic compiler warnings
             about unused variable (GR-P)
    - 2.03:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)
