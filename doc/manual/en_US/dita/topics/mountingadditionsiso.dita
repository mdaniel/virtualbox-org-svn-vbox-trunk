  <title>Installing the Windows Guest Additions</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>In the <b outputclass="bold">Devices</b> menu in the virtual machine's menu bar, <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> has a menu item <b outputclass="bold">Insert Guest Additions
        CD Image</b>, which mounts the Guest Additions ISO file inside your virtual machine. A Windows guest should then
      automatically start the Guest Additions installer, which installs the Guest Additions on your Windows guest. </p>
    <p>For other guest operating systems, or if automatic start of software on a CD is disabled, you need to do a manual
      start of the installer. </p>
    <note>
      <p>For the basic Direct3D acceleration to work in a Windows guest, you have to install the WDDM video driver
        available for Windows Vista or later. </p>
      <p>
            For Windows 8 and later, only the WDDM Direct3D video driver
            is available. For basic Direct3D acceleration to work in
            Windows XP guests, you have to install the Guest Additions
            in Safe Mode. See <xref href="KnownIssues.dita">Known Limitations</xref> for
            details.
          </p>
    </note>
    <p>If you prefer to mount the Guest Additions manually, you can perform the following steps: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Start the virtual machine in which you have installed Windows. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Select <b outputclass="bold">Optical Drives</b> from the <b outputclass="bold">Devices</b> menu in the
          virtual machine's menu bar and then <b outputclass="bold">Choose/Create a Disk Image</b>. This displays the
          Virtual Media Manager, described in <xref href="virtual-media-manager.dita#virtual-media-manager"/>. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the Virtual Media Manager, click <b outputclass="bold">Add</b> and browse your host file system for the
            <filepath>VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</filepath> file. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On a Windows host, this file is in the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> installation
            directory, usually in <filepath>C:\Program files\Oracle\VirtualBox</filepath>. </li>
          <li>
            <p>On macOS hosts, this file is in the application bundle of <ph
                conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. Right-click the <ph
                conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> icon in Finder and choose <b outputclass="bold">Show
                Package Contents</b>. The file is located in the <filepath>Contents/MacOS</filepath> folder. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>On a Linux host, this file is in the <filepath>additions</filepath> folder where you installed <ph
                conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>, usually <filepath>/opt/VirtualBox/</filepath>. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>On Oracle Solaris hosts, this file is in the <filepath>additions</filepath> folder where you installed
                <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>, usually <filepath>/opt/VirtualBox</filepath>. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the Virtual Media Manager, select the ISO file and click the <b outputclass="bold">Add</b> button. This
          mounts the ISO file and presents it to your Windows guest as a CD-ROM. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Unless you have the Autostart feature disabled in your Windows guest, Windows will now autostart the <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> Guest Additions installation program from the Additions ISO.
      If the Autostart feature has been turned off, choose <filepath>VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe</filepath> from the CD/DVD
      drive inside the guest to start the installer. </p>
    <p>The installer will add several device drivers to the Windows driver database and then invoke the hardware
      detection wizard. </p>
    <p>Depending on your configuration, it might display warnings that the drivers are not digitally signed. You must
      confirm these in order to continue the installation and properly install the Additions. </p>
    <p>After installation, reboot your guest operating system to activate the Additions. </p>
