  <title>Enabling DNS Proxy in NAT Mode</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>The NAT engine by default offers the same DNS servers to the guest that are configured on the host. In some
      scenarios, it can be appropriate to hide the DNS server IPs from the guest, for example when this information can
      change on the host due to expiring DHCP leases. In this case, you can tell the NAT engine to act as DNS proxy
      using the following command: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">$ VBoxManage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> --natdnsproxy1 on</pre>
