  <title>Binding NAT Sockets to a Specific Interface</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>By default, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>'s NAT engine will route TCP/IP packets through
      the default interface assigned by the host's TCP/IP stack. The technical reason for this is that the NAT engine
      uses sockets for communication. If you want to change this behavior, you can tell the NAT engine to bind to a
      particular IP address instead. For example, use the following command: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">$ VBoxManage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> \
--natbindip1 "10.45.0.2"</pre>
    <p>After this, all outgoing traffic will be sent through the interface with the IP address 10.45.0.2. Ensure that
      this interface is up and running before changing the NAT bind address. </p>
