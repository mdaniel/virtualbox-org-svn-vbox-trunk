  <title>Using the Host's Resolver as a DNS Proxy in NAT Mode</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>For resolving network names, the DHCP server of the NAT engine offers a list of registered DNS servers of the
      host. If for some reason you need to hide this DNS server list and use the host's resolver settings, thereby
      forcing the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> NAT engine to intercept DNS requests and forward
      them to host's resolver, use the following command: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">$ VBoxManage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> --natdnshostresolver1 on</pre>
    <p>Note that this setting is similar to the DNS proxy mode, however whereas the proxy mode just forwards DNS
      requests to the appropriate servers, the resolver mode will interpret the DNS requests and use the host's DNS API
      to query the information and return it to the guest. </p>
