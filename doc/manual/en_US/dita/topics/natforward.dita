  <title>Configuring Port Forwarding with NAT</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>As the virtual machine is connected to a private network internal to <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> and invisible to the host, network services on the guest are
      not accessible to the host machine or to other computers on the same network. However, like a physical router, <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> can make selected services available to the world outside the
      guest through <i>port forwarding</i>. This means that <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>
      listens to certain ports on the host and resends all packets which arrive there to the guest, on the same or a
      different port. </p>
    <p>To an application on the host or other physical or virtual machines on the network, it looks as though the
      service being proxied is actually running on the host. This also means that you cannot run the same service on the
      same ports on the host. However, you still gain the advantages of running the service in a virtual machine. For
      example, services on the host machine or on other virtual machines cannot be compromised or crashed by a
      vulnerability or a bug in the service, and the service can run in a different operating system than the host
      system. </p>
    <p>To configure port forwarding you can use the graphical <b outputclass="bold">Port Forwarding</b> editor which can
      be found in the <b outputclass="bold">Network</b> settings dialog for network adaptors configured to use NAT.
      Here, you can map host ports to guest ports to allow network traffic to be routed to a specific port in the guest. </p>
    <p>Alternatively, the command line tool <userinput>VBoxManage</userinput> can be used. See <xref
        href="vboxmanage-modifyvm.dita"/>. </p>
    <p>You will need to know which ports on the guest the service uses and to decide which ports to use on the host. You
      may want to use the same ports on the guest and on the host. You can use any ports on the host which are not
      already in use by a service. For example, to set up incoming NAT connections to an <userinput>ssh</userinput>
      server in the guest, use the following command: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --nat-pf1 "guestssh,tcp,,2222,,22"</pre>
    <p>In the above example, all TCP traffic arriving on port 2222 on any host interface will be forwarded to port 22 in
      the guest. The protocol name <codeph>tcp</codeph> is a mandatory attribute defining which protocol should be used
      for forwarding, <codeph>udp</codeph> could also be used. The name <codeph>guestssh</codeph> is purely descriptive
      and will be auto-generated if omitted. The number after <codeph>--nat-pf</codeph> denotes the network card, as
      with other <userinput>VBoxManage</userinput> commands. </p>
    <p>To remove this forwarding rule, use the following command: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --natpf1 delete "guestssh"</pre>
    <p>If for some reason the guest uses a static assigned IP address not leased from the built-in DHCP server, it is
      required to specify the guest IP when registering the forwarding rule, as follows: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --natpf1 "guestssh,tcp,,2222,10.0.2.19,22"</pre>
    <p>This example is identical to the previous one, except that the NAT engine is being told that the guest can be
      found at the 10.0.2.19 address. </p>
    <p>To forward <i>all</i> incoming traffic from a specific host interface to the guest, specify the IP of that host
      interface as follows: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --natpf1 "guestssh,tcp,127.0.0.1,2222,,22"</pre>
    <p>This example forwards all TCP traffic arriving on the localhost interface at 127.0.0.1 through port 2222 to port
      22 in the guest. </p>
    <p>It is possible to configure incoming NAT connections while the VM is running, see <xref
        href="vboxmanage-controlvm.dita"/>. </p>
