  <title>Bridged Networking</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>With bridged networking, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> uses a device driver on your
        <i>host</i> system that filters data from your physical network adapter. This driver is therefore called a
        <i>net filter</i> driver. This enables <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> to intercept data
      from the physical network and inject data into it, effectively creating a new network interface in software. When
      a guest is using such a new software interface, it looks to the host system as though the guest were physically
      connected to the interface using a network cable. The host can send data to the guest through that interface and
      receive data from it. This means that you can set up routing or bridging between the guest and the rest of your
      network. </p>
    <note>
      <p>Even though TAP interfaces are no longer necessary on Linux for bridged networking, you <i>can</i> still use
        TAP interfaces for certain advanced setups, since you can connect a VM to any host interface. </p>
    </note>
    <p>To enable bridged networking, open the <b outputclass="bold">Settings</b> dialog of a virtual machine, go to the
        <b outputclass="bold">Network</b> page and select <b outputclass="bold">Bridged Network</b> in the drop-down
      list for the <b outputclass="bold">Attached To</b> field. Select a host interface from the list at the bottom of
      the page, which contains the physical network interfaces of your systems. On a typical MacBook, for example, this
      will allow you to select between en1: AirPort, which is the wireless interface, and en0: Ethernet, which
      represents the interface with a network cable. </p>
    <note>
      <p>Bridging to a wireless interface is done differently from bridging to a wired interface, because most wireless
        adapters do not support promiscuous mode. All traffic has to use the MAC address of the host's wireless adapter,
        and therefore <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> needs to replace the source MAC address in
        the Ethernet header of an outgoing packet to make sure the reply will be sent to the host interface. When <ph
          conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> sees an incoming packet with a destination IP address that
        belongs to one of the virtual machine adapters it replaces the destination MAC address in the Ethernet header
        with the VM adapter's MAC address and passes it on. <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>
        examines ARP and DHCP packets in order to learn the IP addresses of virtual machines. </p>
    </note>
    <p>Depending on your host operating system, the following limitations apply: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">macOS hosts.</b> Functionality is
          limited when using AirPort, the Mac's wireless networking
          system, for bridged networking. Currently, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>
          supports only IPv4 and IPv6 over AirPort. For other protocols,
          such as IPX, you must choose a wired interface.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Linux hosts.</b> Functionality is
          limited when using wireless interfaces for bridged networking.
          Currently, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> supports only IPv4 and IPv6 over
          wireless. For other protocols, such as IPX, you must choose a
          wired interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, setting the MTU to less than 1500 bytes on wired
          interfaces provided by the sky2 driver on the Marvell Yukon II
          EC Ultra Ethernet NIC is known to cause packet losses under
          certain conditions.
        </p>
        <p> Some adapters strip VLAN tags in hardware. This does not allow you to use VLAN trunking
          between VM and the external network with Linux kernels before 2.6.27, or with host
          operating systems other than Linux. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Oracle Solaris hosts.</b> There
          is no support for using wireless interfaces. Filtering guest
          traffic using IPFilter is also not completely supported due to
          technical restrictions of the Oracle Solaris networking
          subsystem. These issues may be addressed in later releases of
          Oracle Solaris 11.
        </p>
        <p>On Oracle Solaris 11 hosts build 159 and above, it is possible to use Oracle Solaris Crossbow Virtual Network
          Interfaces (VNICs) directly with <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> without any additional
          configuration other than each VNIC must be exclusive for every guest network interface. </p>
        <p>When using VLAN interfaces with <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>, they must be named
          according to the PPA-hack naming scheme, such as e1000g513001. Otherwise, the guest may receive packets in an
          unexpected format. </p>
