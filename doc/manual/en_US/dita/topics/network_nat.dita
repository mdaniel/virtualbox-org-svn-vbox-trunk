  <title>Network Address Translation (NAT)</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is the simplest way of accessing an external network from a virtual machine.
      Usually, it does not require any configuration on the host network and guest system. For this reason, it is the
      default networking mode in <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. </p>
    <p>A virtual machine with NAT enabled acts much like a real computer that connects to the Internet through a router.
      The router, in this case, is the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> networking engine, which
      maps traffic from and to the virtual machine transparently. In <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"
      /> this router is placed between each virtual machine and the host. This separation maximizes security since by
      default virtual machines cannot talk to each other. </p>
    <p>The disadvantage of NAT mode is that, much like a private network behind a router, the virtual machine is
      invisible and unreachable from the outside internet. You cannot run a server this way unless you set up port
      forwarding. See <xref href="natforward.dita#natforward"/>. </p>
    <p>The network frames sent out by the guest operating system are received by <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>'s NAT engine, which extracts the TCP/IP data and resends it
      using the host operating system. To an application on the host, or to another computer on the same network as the
      host, it looks like the data was sent by the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> application on
      the host, using an IP address belonging to the host. <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> listens
      for replies to the packages sent, and repacks and resends them to the guest machine on its private network. </p>
    <note>
      <p>Even though the NAT engine separates the VM from the host, the VM has access to the host's loopback interface
        and the network services running on it. The host's loopback interface is accessible as IP address 10.0.2.2. This
        access to the host's loopback interface can be extremely useful in some cases, for example when running a web
        application under development in the VM and the database server on the loopback interface on the host. </p>
    </note>
    <p>The virtual machine receives its network address and configuration on the private network from a DHCP server
      integrated into <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. The IP address thus assigned to the virtual
      machine is usually on a completely different network than the host. As more than one card of a virtual machine can
      be set up to use NAT, the first card is connected to the private network 10.0.2.0, the second card to the network
      10.0.3.0 and so on. If you need to change the guest-assigned IP range, see <xref href="changenat.dita">Fine Tuning
        the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> NAT Engine</xref>. </p>
