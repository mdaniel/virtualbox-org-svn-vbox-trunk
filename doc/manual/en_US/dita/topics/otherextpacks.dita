  <title>Other Extension Packs</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>Another extension pack called VNC is available. This extension pack is open source and replaces the previous
      integration of the VNC remote access protocol. This is experimental code, and is initially available in the <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> source code package only. It is to a large portion code
      contributed by users, and is not supported in any way by Oracle. </p>
    <p>The keyboard handling is severely limited, and only the US keyboard layout works. Other keyboard layouts will
      have at least some keys which produce the wrong results, often with quite surprising effects, and for layouts
      which have significant differences to the US keyboard layout it is most likely unusable. </p>
    <p>It is possible to install both the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/vbox-ext"/> and VNC, but only one VRDE
      module can be active at any time. The following command switches to the VNC VRDE module in VNC: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage setproperty vrdeextpack VNC</pre>
    <p>Configuring the remote access works very similarly to VRDP, see <xref href="vrde.dita#vrde"/>, with some
      limitations. VNC does not support specifying several port numbers, and the authentication is done differently. VNC
      can only deal with password authentication, and there is no option to use password hashes. This leaves no other
      choice than having a clear-text password in the VM configuration, which can be set with the following command: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> --vrde-property VNCPassword=secret</pre>
    <p>The user is responsible for keeping this password secret, and it should be removed when a VM configuration is
      passed to another person, for whatever purpose. Some VNC servers claim to have encrypted passwords in the
      configuration. This is not true encryption, it is only concealing the passwords, which is only as secure as using
      clear-text passwords. </p>
    <p>The following command switches back to VRDP, if installed: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage setproperty vrdeextpack "<ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/vbox-ext"/>"</pre>
