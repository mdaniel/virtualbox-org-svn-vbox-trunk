  <title>Importing an Appliance in OVF Format</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>The following steps show how to import an appliance in OVF format. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Double-click the OVF or OVA file. </p>
        <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> creates file type associations automatically for any
          OVF and OVA files on your host OS. </p>
        <p>The <b outputclass="bold">Appliance Settings</b> page of the <b outputclass="bold">Import Virtual
            Appliance</b> wizard is shown. This page shows the VMs described in the OVF or OVA file and enables you to
          change the VM settings. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By default, membership of VM groups is preserved on import for VMs that were initially exported from <ph
            conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. You can change this behavior by using the <b
            outputclass="bold">Primary Group</b> setting for the VM. </p>
        <p>The following global settings apply to all of the VMs that you import: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">Base Folder:</b> Specifies
                the directory on the host in which to store the imported
                VMs.
              </p>
            <p>If an appliance has multiple VMs, you can specify a different directory for each VM by editing the <b
                outputclass="bold">Base Folder</b> setting for the VM. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">MAC Address Policy:</b>
                Reinitializes the MAC addresses of network cards in your
                VMs prior to import, by default. You can override the
                default behavior and preserve the MAC addresses on
                import.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">Import Hard Drives as
                VDI:</b> Imports hard drives in the VDI format
                rather than in the default VMDK format.
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click <b outputclass="bold">Finish</b> to import the appliance. </p>
        <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> copies the disk images and creates local VMs with the
          settings described on the <b outputclass="bold">Appliance Settings</b> page. The imported VMs are shown in the
          list of VMs in VirtualBox Manager. </p>
        <p>Because disk images are large, the VMDK images that are included with virtual appliances are shipped in a
          compressed format that cannot be used directly by VMs. So, the images are first unpacked and copied, which
          might take several minutes. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can use the <userinput>VBoxManage import</userinput> command to import an appliance. See <xref
        href="vboxmanage-import.dita"/>. </p>
