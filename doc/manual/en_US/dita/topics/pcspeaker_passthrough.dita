  <title>PC Speaker Passthrough</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>As an experimental feature, primarily due to being limited to Linux host only and unknown Linux distribution
      coverage, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> supports passing through the PC speaker to the
      host. The PC speaker, sometimes called the system speaker, is a way to produce audible feedback such as beeps
      without the need for regular audio and sound card support. </p>
    <p>The PC speaker passthrough feature in <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> handles beeps only.
      Advanced PC speaker use by the VM, such as PCM audio, will not work, resulting in undefined host behavior. </p>
    <p>Producing beeps on Linux is a very complex topic. <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> offers a
      collection of options, in an attempt to make this work deterministically and reliably on as many Linux
      distributions and system configurations as possible. These are summarized in the following table. </p>

    <p>To enable PC speaker passthrough use the following command: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage setextradata <varname>VM-name</varname> "VBoxInternal/Devices/i8254/0/Config/PassthroughSpeaker" <varname>N</varname>
               </pre>
    <p>Replace <varname>N</varname> with the code representing the case you want to use. Changing this setting takes
      effect when you next start the VM. It is safe to enable PC speaker passthrough on all host OSes. It will only have
      an effect on Linux. </p>
    <p>The VM log file, <filepath>VBox.log</filepath>, contains lines with the prefix <codeph>PIT: speaker:</codeph>
      showing the PC speaker passthrough setup activities. It gives hints which device it picked or why it failed. </p>
    <p>Enabling PC speaker passthrough for the VM is usually the simple part. The real difficulty is making sure that
        <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> can access the necessary device, because in a typical
      Linux install most of them can only be accessed by user <codeph>root</codeph>. You should follow the preferred way
      to persistently change this, such as by referring to your distribution's documentation. Since there are countless
      Linux distribution variants, we can only give the general hints that there is often a way to give the X11 session
      user access to additional devices, or you need to find a working solution using a udev configuration file. If
      everything fails you might try setting the permissions using a script which is run late enough in the host system
      startup. </p>
    <p>Sometimes additional rules are applied by the kernel to limit access. For example, that the VM process must have
      the same controlling terminal as the device configured to be used for beeping, something which is often very
      difficult to achieve for GUI applications such as <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. The table
      above contains some hints, but in general refer to the Linux documentation. </p>
    <p>If you have trouble getting any beeps even if the device permissions are set up and VBox.log confirms that it
      uses evdev or console for the PC speaker control, check if your system has a PC speaker. Some systems do not have
      one. Other complications can arise from Linux rerouting the PC speaker output to a sound card. Check if the beeps
      are audible if you connect speakers to your sound card. Today almost all systems have one. Finally, check if the
      audio mixer control has a channel named <i>beep</i>, which could be hidden in the mixer settings, and that it is
      not muted. </p>
