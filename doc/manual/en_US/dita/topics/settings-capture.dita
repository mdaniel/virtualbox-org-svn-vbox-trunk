  <title>Recording Tab</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>On the <b outputclass="bold">Recording</b> tab you can enable video and audio recording for a virtual machine and change related settings. Note that these features can be enabled and disabled while a VM is running. Settings apply to all selected screens.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Enable Recording:</b> Select
            this check box and select a <b outputclass="bold">Recording
            Mode</b> option.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Recording Mode:</b> You can
            choose to record video, audio, or both video and audio.
          </p>
        <p>Some settings on the <b outputclass="bold">Recording</b> tab may be grayed out, depending on the <b
            outputclass="bold">Recording Mode</b> setting. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">File Path:</b> The file where
            the recording is saved.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Frame Size:</b> The video
            resolution of the recorded video, in pixels. The drop-down
            list enables you to select from common frame sizes.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Frame Rate:</b> Use the slider
            to set the maximum number of video frames per second (FPS)
            to record. Frames that have a higher frequency are skipped.
            Increasing this value reduces the number of skipped frames
            and increases the file size.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Video Quality:</b> Use the slider to set the bit rate of the video
          in kilobits per second. Increasing this value improves the appearance of the video at the
          cost of an increased file size. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Audio Quality:</b> Use the
            slider to set the quality of the audio recording. Increasing
            this value improves the audio quality at the cost of an
            increased file size.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">Screens:</b> For a multiple
            monitor display, you can select which screens to record
            video from.
          </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you adjust the video and audio recording settings, the approximate output file size for a five minute video is
      shown. </p>
