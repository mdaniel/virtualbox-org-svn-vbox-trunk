  <title>Storage Settings</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>The <b outputclass="bold">Storage</b> category in the VM settings enables you to connect virtual hard disk and
      CD/DVD images and drives to your virtual machine. </p>
    <p>In a real computer, so-called <i>storage controllers</i> connect physical disk drives to the rest of the
      computer. Similarly, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> presents virtual storage controllers to
      a virtual machine. Under each controller, the virtual devices, such as hard disks and CD/DVD drives, attached to
      the controller are shown. </p>
    <note>
      <p>This section gives a quick introduction to the <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> storage
        settings. See <xref href="storage.dita#storage"/> for a full description of the available storage settings in
          <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. </p>
    </note>
    <p>Depending on the guest OS type that you selected when you created the VM, a new VM includes the following storage
      devices: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">IDE controller.</b> A virtual
          CD/DVD drive is attached to device 0 on the secondary channel
          of the IDE controller.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">SATA controller.</b> This is a
          modern type of storage controller for higher hard disk data
          throughput, to which the virtual hard disks are attached.
          Initially you will normally have one such virtual disk, but as
          shown in the previous screenshot, you can have more than one.
          Each is represented by a disk image file, such as a VDI file
          in this example.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>VMs with an Arm architecture have VirtIO SCSI only.</p>
    <p>If you created your VM with an older version of <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>, the
      default storage layout may differ. You might then only have an IDE controller to which both the CD/DVD drive and
      the hard disks have been attached. This might also apply if you selected an older OS type when you created the VM.
      Since older OSes do not support SATA without additional drivers, <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> will make sure that no such devices are present initially. See
        <xref href="harddiskcontrollers.dita#harddiskcontrollers"/>. </p>
    <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> also provides a <i>floppy controller</i>. You cannot add
      devices other than floppy drives to this controller. Virtual floppy drives, like virtual CD/DVD drives, can be
      connected to either a host floppy drive, if you have one, or a disk image, which in this case must be in RAW
      format. </p>
    <p>You can modify these media attachments freely. For example, if you want to copy some files from another virtual
      disk that you created, you can connect that disk as a second hard disk, as in the above screenshot. You could also
      add a second virtual CD/DVD drive, or change where these items are attached. The following options are available: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>To <b outputclass="bold">add another virtual hard disk, or a CD/DVD or floppy drive</b>, select the storage
          controller to which it should be added (such as IDE, SATA, SCSI, SAS, floppy controller) and then click the <b
            outputclass="bold">Add Disk</b> button below the tree. You can then either select <b outputclass="bold"
            >Optical Drive</b> or <b outputclass="bold">Hard Disk</b>. If you clicked on a floppy controller, you can
          add a floppy drive instead. Alternatively, right-click the storage controller and select a menu item there. </p>
        <p>A dialog is displayed, enabling you to select an existing disk image file or to create a new disk image file.
          Depending on the type of disk image, the dialog is called <b outputclass="bold">Hard Disk Selector</b>, <b
            outputclass="bold">Optical Disk Selector</b>, or <b outputclass="bold">Floppy Disk Selector</b>. </p>
        <p>See <xref href="vdidetails.dita#vdidetails"/> for information on the image file types that are supported by
            <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>. </p>
        <p>For virtual CD/DVD drives, the image files will typically be in the standard ISO format instead. Most
          commonly, you will select this option when installing an OS from an ISO file that you have obtained from the
          Internet. For example, most Linux distributions are available in this way. </p>
        <p>Depending on the type of disk image, you can set the following <b outputclass="bold">Attributes</b> for the
          disk image in the right part of the Storage settings page: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The <b outputclass="bold">device slot</b> of the controller that the virtual disk is connected to. IDE
              controllers have four slots: primary device 0, primary device 1, secondary device 0, and secondary device
              1. By contrast, SATA and SCSI controllers offer you up to 30 slots for attaching virtual devices. </p>
          </li>
          <li><b outputclass="bold">Solid-state Drive</b> presents a virtual disk to the guest as a solid-state device. </li>
          <li><b outputclass="bold">Hot-pluggable</b> presents a virtual disk to the guest as a hot-pluggable device. </li>
          <li>
            <p>For virtual CD/DVD drives, you can select <b outputclass="bold">Live CD/DVD</b>. This means that the
              virtual optical disk is not removed from when the guest system ejects it. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To <b outputclass="bold">remove an attachment</b>, either select it and click the <b outputclass="bold"
            >Remove</b> icon at the bottom, or right-click the attachment and select the menu item. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Removable media, such as CD/DVDs and floppies, can be changed while the guest is running. Since the <b
        outputclass="bold">Settings</b> window is not available at that time, you can also access these settings from
      the <b outputclass="bold">Devices</b> menu of your virtual machine window. </p>
