               <p>The <b outputclass="bold">System</b> category groups various settings that are related to the basic
      hardware that is presented to the virtual machine. </p>
               <note>
                  <p>As the activation mechanism of Microsoft Windows is sensitive to hardware changes, if you are
        changing hardware settings for a Windows guest, some of these changes may trigger a request for another
        activation with Microsoft. </p>
