                  <p>The <b outputclass="bold">USB</b> section in a virtual machine's <b
        outputclass="bold">Settings</b> window enables you to configure <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>'s sophisticated USB support. </p>
                  <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> can enable virtual
      machines to access the USB devices on your host directly. To achieve this, <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> presents the guest OS with a virtual USB
      controller. </p>
                  <p>
      <note id="note_bzl_prv_qbc" type="caution">
        <p>As soon as the guest system starts using a USB device, it will be disconnected from the
          host without a proper shutdown. This may cause data loss.</p>
      </note>
      </p>
                  <note>
      <p>Oracle Solaris hosts have a few known limitations regarding USB support. See <xref
          href="KnownIssues.dita">Known Limitations</xref>. </p>
    </note>
                  <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> also enables your guests
      to connect to remote USB devices by use of the VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension (VRDE). See
        <xref href="usb-over-rdp.dita">Remote USB</xref>. </p>

      <ol id="ol_fpr_wsv_qbc">
        <li>Ensure the VM is not running.</li>
        <li>Select the VM in the machine list, and then click <b outputclass="bold"
          >Settings</b>.</li>
        <li>On the USB tab, select <b outputclass="bold">Enable USB Controller</b> and choose the
        USB Controller you need for your guest OS. In most cases this will be xHCI. Only use OHCI or
        EHCI if your guest OS does not support xHCI. For some legacy Windows guests you'll need to
        install third party drivers for xHCI support. <p>
          <ul id="ul_rzz_l5v_qbc">
            <li>OHCI supports USB 1.1 </li>
            <li>EHCI supports USB 2.0. This also enables OHCI.</li>
            <li>xHCI supports all USB speeds up to USB 3.0</li>
                     </ul>

                     <li>Specify which devices can be attached to the guest by adding <b
          outputclass="bold">USB Device Filters</b>. USB devices with a matching filter will be
        automatically passed to the guest once they are attached to the host. USB devices without a
        matching filter can be passed manually to the guest, for example by using the <b
          outputclass="bold">Devices</b>, <b outputclass="bold">USB</b> menu. <ul
          id="ul_jjz_cxv_qbc">
          <li>Click the <b>USB filter</b> button to create a new filter with blank fields, and then
            complete the fields. </li>
          <li>Or, click the <b>Add USB filter</b> button to create a filter with the fields
            completed for the selected USB device. </li>
        </ul><p>Give the filter a name, for later reference, and specify the filter criteria. The
          more criteria you specify, the more precisely devices will be selected. For instance, if
          you specify only a vendor ID of 046d, all devices produced by Logitech will be available
          to the guest. If you fill in all fields, on the other hand, the filter will only apply to
          a particular device model from a particular vendor, and not even to other devices of the
          same type with a different revision and serial number. </p><p>The following criteria are
          available: </p><ul id="ul_av4_41w_qbc">
                     <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">Vendor and Product ID.</b> With USB, each vendor of USB
              products carries an identification number that is unique world-wide, called the
                <i>vendor ID</i>. Similarly, each line of products is assigned a <i>product ID</i>
              number. Both numbers are commonly written in hexadecimal, and a colon separates the
              vendor from the product ID. For example, <codeph>046d:c016</codeph> stands for
              Logitech as a vendor, and the M-UV69a Optical Wheel Mouse product. </p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can also specify <b outputclass="bold">Manufacturer</b> and <b
                outputclass="bold">Product</b> by name. </p>
            <p>To list all the USB devices that are connected to your host machine with their
              respective vendor IDs and product IDs, use the following command: </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve" id="pre_bv4_41w_qbc">VBoxManage list usbhost</pre>
            <p>On Windows, you can also see all USB devices that are attached to your system in the
              Device Manager. On Linux, you can use the <userinput>lsusb</userinput> command. </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">Serial Number.</b> While vendor ID and product ID are quite
              specific to identify USB devices, if you have two identical devices of the same brand
              and product line, you will also need their serial numbers to filter them out
              correctly. </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">Remote.</b> This setting specifies whether the device will be
              local only, remote only, such as over VRDP, or either. </p>
                           </li>
        </ul><p>As an example, you could create a new USB filter and specify a vendor ID of 046d for
          Logitech, Inc, a manufacturer index of 1, and <i>not remote</i>. Then any USB devices on
          the host system produced by Logitech, Inc with a manufacturer index of 1 will be visible
          to the guest system. </p><p>Several filters can select a single device. For example, a
          filter which selects all Logitech devices, and one which selects a particular webcam.
        </p></li>
                     <li>
        <p>On a Windows host, you will need to unplug and reconnect a USB device to use it after
          creating a filter for it. </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
        <p>Ensure the filters you need immediately are selected in the list. Selected filters will
          be attached automatically when the VM starts.</p>
