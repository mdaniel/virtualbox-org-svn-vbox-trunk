  <title>Passing Through SSE4.1/SSE4.2 Instructions</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>To provide SSE 4.1/SSE 4.2 support to guests, the host CPU has to implement these instruction sets. The
      instruction sets are exposed to guests by default, but it is possible to disable the instructions for certain
      guests by using the following commands: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">$ VBoxManage setextradata <varname>VM-name</varname> \
VBoxInternal/CPUM/IsaExts/SSE4.1 0
$ VBoxManage setextradata <varname>VM-name</varname> \
VBoxInternal/CPUM/IsaExts/SSE4.2 0</pre>
    <p>These are per-VM settings which are enabled by default. </p>
  </body>
