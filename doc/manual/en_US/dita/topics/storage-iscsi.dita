               <p>iSCSI stands for <i>Internet SCSI</i> and is a standard that supports use of the SCSI protocol over
      Internet (TCP/IP) connections. Especially with the advent of Gigabit Ethernet, it has become affordable to attach
      iSCSI storage servers simply as remote hard disks to a computer network. In iSCSI terminology, the server
      providing storage resources is called an <i>iSCSI target</i>, while the client connecting to the server and
      accessing its resources is called an <i>iSCSI initiator</i>. </p>
               <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> can transparently present iSCSI remote storage
      to a virtual machine as a virtual hard disk. The guest OS will not see any difference between a virtual disk image
      (VDI file) and an iSCSI target. To achieve this, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> has an
      integrated iSCSI initiator. </p>
               <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>'s iSCSI support has been developed according to
      the iSCSI standard and should work with all standard-conforming iSCSI targets. To use an iSCSI target with <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>, you must use the command line. See <xref
        href="vboxmanage-storageattach.dita"/>. </p>
