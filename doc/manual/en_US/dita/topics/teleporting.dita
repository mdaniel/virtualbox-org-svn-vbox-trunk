    <p><ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> supports <i>teleporting</i>. Teleporting is moving a
      virtual machine over a network from one <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> host to another,
      while the virtual machine is running. This works regardless of the host operating system that is running on the
      hosts. You can teleport virtual machines between Oracle Solaris and macOS hosts, for example. </p>
    <p>Teleporting requires that a machine be currently running on one host, which is called the <i>source</i>. The host
      to which the virtual machine will be teleported is called the <i>target</i>. The machine on the target is then
      configured to wait for the source to contact the target. The machine's running state will then be transferred from
      the source to the target with minimal downtime. </p>
    <p>Teleporting happens over any TCP/IP network. The source and the target only need to agree on a TCP/IP port which
      is specified in the teleporting settings. </p>
    <p>At this time, there are a few prerequisites for this to work, as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>On the target host, you must configure a virtual machine in <ph
            conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> with exactly the same hardware settings as the machine on
          the source that you want to teleport. This does not apply to settings which are merely descriptive, such as
          the VM name, but obviously for teleporting to work, the target machine must have the same amount of memory and
          other hardware settings. Otherwise teleporting will fail with an error message. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The two virtual machines on the source and the target must share the same storage, hard disks as well as
          floppy disks and CD/DVD images. This means that they either use the same iSCSI targets or that the storage
          resides somewhere on the network and both hosts have access to it using NFS or SMB/CIFS. </p>
        <p>This also means that neither the source nor the target machine can have any snapshots. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To configure teleporting, perform the following steps: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>On the <i>target</i> host, configure the virtual machine to wait for a teleport request to arrive when it is
          started, instead of actually attempting to start the machine. This is done with the following
            <userinput>VBoxManage</userinput> command: </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage modifyvm <varname>targetvmname</varname> --teleporter on --teleporter-port <varname>port</varname>
                     </pre>
        <p><varname>targetvmname</varname> is the name of the
          virtual machine on the target host and
          <varname>port</varname> is a TCP/IP port number to be
          used on both the source and the target hosts. For example, use
          6000. See <xref href="vboxmanage-modifyvm.dita">VBoxManage modifyvm</xref>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Start the VM on the target host. Instead of running, the VM shows a progress dialog, indicating that it is
          waiting for a teleport request to arrive. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Start the VM on the <i>source</i> host as usual. When it is running and you want it to be teleported, issue
          the following command on the source host: </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage controlvm <varname>sourcevmname</varname> teleport --host <varname>targethost</varname> --port <varname>port</varname>
                     </pre>
        <p>where <varname>sourcevmname</varname> is the name of the virtual machine on the source host, which is the
          machine that is currently running. <varname>targethost</varname> is the host or IP name of the target host on
          which the machine is waiting for the teleport request, and <varname>port</varname> must be the same number as
          specified in the command on the target host. See <xref href="vboxmanage-controlvm.dita">VBoxManage
            controlvm</xref>. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For testing, you can also teleport machines on the same host. In that case, use localhost as the hostname on both
      the source and the target host. </p>
    <note>
      <p>In rare cases, if the CPUs of the source and the target are very different, teleporting can fail with an error
        message, or the target may hang. This may happen especially if the VM is running application software that is
        highly optimized to run on a particular CPU without correctly checking that certain CPU features are actually
        present. <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> filters what CPU capabilities are presented to
        the guest operating system. Advanced users can attempt to restrict these virtual CPU capabilities with the
          <userinput>VBoxManage modifyvm --cpuid-portability-level</userinput> command. See <xref
          href="vboxmanage-modifyvm.dita">VBoxManage modifyvm</xref>. </p>
