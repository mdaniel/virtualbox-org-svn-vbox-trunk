  <title>GUI: 2D Video Acceleration Option is Grayed Out</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
        To use 2D Video Acceleration within <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>, your host's
        video card should support certain OpenGL extensions. On startup,
        <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> checks for those extensions, and, if the test
        fails, this option is silently grayed out.
      </p>
    <p>
        To find out why it has failed, you can manually execute the
        following command:
      </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">$ VBoxTestOGL --log "log_file_name" --test 2D</pre>
    <p>
        It will list the required OpenGL extensions one by one and will
        show you which one failed the test. This usually means that you
        are running an outdated or misconfigured OpenGL driver on your
        host. It can also mean that your video chip is lacking required
        functionality.
