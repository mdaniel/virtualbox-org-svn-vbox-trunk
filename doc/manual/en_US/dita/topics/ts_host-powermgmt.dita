  <title>Poor Performance Caused by Host Power Management</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
        On some hardware platforms and operating systems, virtualization
        performance is negatively affected by host CPU power management.
        The symptoms may be choppy audio in the guest or erratic guest
        clock behavior.
      </p>
    <p> Some of the problems may be caused by firmware or host operating system bugs. Therefore,
      updating the firmware and applying operating system fixes is recommended. </p>
    <p>
        For optimal virtualization performance, the C1E power state
        support in the system's BIOS should be disabled, if such a
        setting is available. Not all systems support the C1E power
        state. On Intel systems, the <codeph>Intel C State</codeph>
        setting should be disabled. Disabling other power management
        settings may also improve performance. However, a balance
        between performance and power consumption must always be
        considered.
