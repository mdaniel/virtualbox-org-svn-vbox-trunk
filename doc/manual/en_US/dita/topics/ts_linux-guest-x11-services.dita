  <title>Shared Clipboard, Auto-Resizing, and Seamless Desktop in X11 Guests</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>
        Guest desktop services in guests running the X11 window system
        such as Oracle Solaris and Linux, are provided by a guest
        service called <userinput>VBoxClient</userinput>, which runs under
        the ID of the user who started the desktop session and is
        automatically started using the following command lines when
        your X11 user session is started if you are using a common
        desktop environment such as Gnome or KDE.
      </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">$ VBoxClient --clipboard
$ VBoxClient --display
$ VBoxClient --seamless</pre>
    <p>
        If a particular desktop service is not working correctly, it is
        worth checking whether the process which should provide it is
        running.
      </p>
    <p> The <userinput>VBoxClient</userinput> processes create files in the user's home directory
      with names of the form <filepath>.vboxclient-*.pid</filepath> when they are running in order
      to prevent a given service from being started twice. It can happen due to misconfiguration
      that these files are created owned by root and not deleted when the services are stopped,
      which will prevent them from being started in future sessions. If the services cannot be
      started, you may want to check whether these files still exist. </p>
