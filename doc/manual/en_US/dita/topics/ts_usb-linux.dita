  <title>USB Not Working</title>
  
  <body>
    <p> If USB is not working on your Linux host, make sure that the current user is a member of the
        <codeph>vboxusers</codeph> group. Please remember that group membership does not take effect
      immediately but rather at the next login. If available, the <userinput>newgrp</userinput>
      command may avoid the need for a logout and login. </p>
