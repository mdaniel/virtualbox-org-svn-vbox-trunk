  <title>Drag'n Drop not Working</title>
  
  <body>     
    <p> Microsoft Windows uses technologies like UAC (User Account Control) and UIPI (User Interface
      Privilege Isolation) to prevent and mitigate security issues. By default, UAC and UIPI are
      enabled. </p>
    <p> When an <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> VM process is running with a
      higher so-called privilege level than another process that wants to interact with the VM
      process using drag'n drop (or system clipboard), Windows prevents this by default due to
      security reasons. This results in <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> not
      being able to receive any Windows messages for drag'n drop. To make this work, the <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> VM process must be running with the same
      (or lower) privilege level as the process it is interacting with using drag'n drop.</p>
      
      <p>Disabling UAC or UIPI is not recommended. </p>
