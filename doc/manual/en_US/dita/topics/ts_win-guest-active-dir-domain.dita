  <title>Windows Guests are Removed From an Active Directory Domain After
        Restoring a Snapshot</title>
  
  <body>
    <p> If a Windows guest is a member of an Active Directory domain and the snapshot feature of <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> is used, it could be removed from the Active Directory domain after you restore an older snapshot. </p>
    <p> This is caused by automatic machine password changes performed by Windows at regular intervals for security purposes. You can disable this feature as shown in this <xref href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/154501" format="html" scope="external">article from Microsoft</xref>. </p>
