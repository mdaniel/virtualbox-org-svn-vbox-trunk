               <title>Implementation Notes for Windows and Linux Hosts</title>
               
               <body>
                  <p>On Windows hosts, a kernel mode device driver provides USB proxy support. It implements both a USB
      monitor, which enables <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> to capture devices when they are
      plugged in, and a USB device driver to claim USB devices for a particular virtual machine. System reboots are not
      necessary after installing the driver. Also, you do not need to replug devices for <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> to claim them. </p>
                  <p>On supported Linux hosts, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> accesses USB
      devices through special files in the file system. When <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> is
      installed, these are made available to all users in the <codeph>vboxusers</codeph> system group. In order to be
      able to access USB from guest systems, make sure that you are a member of this group. </p>
