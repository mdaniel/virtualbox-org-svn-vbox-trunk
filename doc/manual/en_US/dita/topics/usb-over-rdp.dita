  <title>Remote USB</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>As a special feature additional to the VRDP support, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> also
      supports remote USB devices over the wire. That is, an <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> guest
      that runs on one computer can access the USB devices of the remote computer on which the VRDP data is being
      displayed the same way as USB devices that are connected to the actual host. This enables running of virtual
      machines on an <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> host that acts as a server, where a client
      can connect from elsewhere that needs only a network adapter and a display capable of running an RDP viewer. When
      USB devices are plugged into the client, the remote <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> server
      can access them. </p>
    <p>For these remote USB devices, the same filter rules apply as for other USB devices. See <xref
        href="settings-usb.dita">USB Settings</xref>. All you have to do is specify Remote, or Any, when setting up
      these rules. </p>
    <p>Accessing remote USB devices is only possible if the RDP client supports this extension. Some versions of
        <userinput>uttsc</userinput>, a client tailored for the use with Sun Ray thin clients, support accessing remote
      USB devices. RDP clients for other platforms will be provided in future <ph
        conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> versions. </p>
