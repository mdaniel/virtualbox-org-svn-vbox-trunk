  <title>Security Considerations</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>The communication between the server and client is unencrypted and there is no authorization required to access
      exported devices. An attacker might sniff sensitive data or gain control over a device. To mitigate this risk, the
      device should be exposed over a local network to which only trusted clients have access. To access the device
      remotely over a public network, a VPN solution should be used to provide the required level of security
      protection. </p>
