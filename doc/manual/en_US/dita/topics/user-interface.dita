                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Menu Bar:</b> This widget enables you to disable a complete menu, by
          clicking on the menu name to deselect it. Menu entries can be disabled, by deselecting the check box next to
          the entry. On Windows and Linux hosts, the complete menu bar can be disabled by deselecting the check box on
          the right. </p>

                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Mini ToolBar:</b> In full screen or seamless mode, <ph
            conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> can display a small toolbar that contains some of the
          items that are normally available from the virtual machine's menu bar. This toolbar reduces itself to a small
          gray line unless you move the mouse over it. With the toolbar, you can return from full screen or seamless
          mode, control machine execution, or enable certain devices. If you do not want to see the toolbar, disable the
            <b outputclass="bold">Show in Full Screen/Seamless</b> setting. </p>
                     <p>The <b outputclass="bold">Show at Top of Screen</b> setting enables you to show the toolbar at
          the top of the screen, instead of showing it at the bottom. </p>
                     <p>The Mini Toolbar is not available on macOS hosts. </p>

          the status bar. Deselect the check box of an icon to disable it, or rearrange icons by dragging and dropping
          the icon. To disable the complete status bar deselect the check box on the left. </p>
