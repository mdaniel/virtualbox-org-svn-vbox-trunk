        <p>Due to different Windows sessions having their own set of resources, there might be some issues with
          accessing network shares created in the interactive user session when at least one of the <ph
            conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> processes are running in session 0. </p>
        <p>For accessing network shares within session 0, a possible workaround is to establish permanent access to the
          share and then restart the host. </p>
