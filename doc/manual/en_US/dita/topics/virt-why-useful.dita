            <title>Why is Virtualization Useful?</title>
            
            <body>
               <p>The techniques and features that <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> provides are
         useful in the following scenarios: </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Running multiple operating systems simultaneously.</b>
          <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> enables you to run more than one OS at a time. This way,
          you can run software written for one OS on another, such as Windows software on Linux or a Mac, without having
          to reboot to use it. Since you can configure what kinds of <i>virtual</i> hardware should be presented to each
          such OS, you can install an old OS such as DOS or OS/2 even if your real computer's hardware is no longer
          supported by that OS. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Easier software installations.</b> Software vendors can use virtual
          machines to ship entire software configurations. For example, installing a complete mail server solution on a
          real machine can be a tedious task. With <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/>, such a complex
          setup, often called an <i>appliance</i>, can be packed into a virtual machine. Installing and running a mail
          server becomes as easy as importing such an appliance into <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"
          />. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Testing and disaster recovery.</b> Once installed, a virtual machine and
          its virtual hard disks can be considered a <i>container</i> that can be arbitrarily frozen, woken up, copied,
          backed up, and transported between hosts. </p>
                     <p>Using virtual machines enables you to build and test a multinode networked
          service, for example. Issues with networking, operating system, and software configuration
          can be investigated easily. </p>
                     <p>In addition to that, with the use of another <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"
          /> feature called <i>snapshots</i>, one can save a particular state of a virtual machine and revert back to
          that state, if necessary. This way, one can freely experiment with a computing environment. If something goes
          wrong, such as problems after installing software or infecting the guest with a virus, you can easily switch
          back to a previous snapshot and avoid the need of frequent backups and restores. </p>
                     <p>Any number of snapshots can be created, allowing you to travel back and forward in virtual
          machine time. You can delete snapshots while a VM is running to reclaim disk space. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Infrastructure consolidation.</b> Virtualization can significantly reduce
          hardware and electricity costs. Most of the time, computers today only use a fraction of their potential power
          and run with low average system loads. A lot of hardware resources as well as electricity is thereby wasted.
          So, instead of running many such physical computers that are only partially used, one can pack many virtual
          machines onto a few powerful hosts and balance the loads between them. </p>
