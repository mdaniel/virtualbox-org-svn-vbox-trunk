               <p>When dealing with virtualization, and also for understanding the following
      chapters of this documentation, it helps to acquaint yourself with some important terminology,
      especially the following terms: </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Host operating system (host OS).</b> This is the OS of the physical
          computer on which <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> was installed. There are versions of
            <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Oracle Solaris hosts.
          See <xref href="hostossupport.dita#hostossupport"/>. </p>
                     <p>Most of the time, this user guide discusses all <ph
            conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> versions together. There may be platform-specific
          differences which we will point out where appropriate. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Guest operating system (guest OS).</b> This is the OS that is running inside the virtual machine. Theoretically, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> can run any x86 OS such as DOS, Windows, OS/2, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD on an x86 host. But to achieve near-native performance of the guest code on your machine, we had to go through a lot of optimizations that are specific to certain OSs. So while your favorite OS <i>may</i> run as a guest, we officially support and optimize for a select few, which include the most common OSs. </p>
                     <p>See <xref href="guest-os.dita"/>.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Virtual machine (VM).</b> This is the special environment that <ph
            conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> creates for your guest OS while it is running. In other
          words, you run your guest OS <i>in</i> a VM. Normally, a VM is shown as a window on your computer's desktop.
          Depending on which of the various frontends of <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> you use,
          the VM might be shown in full screen mode or remotely on another computer. </p>
                     <p>Internally, <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> treats a VM as a set of
          parameters that specify its behavior. Some parameters describe hardware settings, such as the amount of memory
          and number of CPUs assigned. Other parameters describe the state information, such as whether the VM is
          running or saved. </p>
                     <p>You can view these VM settings in <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/vbox-mgr"/>, in the <b
            outputclass="bold">Settings</b> window, and by running the <userinput>VBoxManage</userinput> command. See
            <xref href="vboxmanage.dita#vboxmanage"/>. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><b outputclass="bold">Guest Additions.</b> This refers to special software packages which are
          shipped with <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> but designed to be installed <i>inside</i>
          a VM to improve performance of the guest OS and to add extra features. See <xref
            href="guestadditions.dita#guestadditions"/>. </p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
