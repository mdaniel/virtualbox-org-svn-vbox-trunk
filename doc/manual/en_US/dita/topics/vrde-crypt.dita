  <title>RDP Encryption</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>RDP features data stream encryption, which is based on the RC4 symmetric cipher, with keys up to 128-bit. The RC4
      keys are replaced at regular intervals, every 4096 packets. </p>
    <p>RDP provides the following different authentication methods: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">RDP 4</b> authentication was
            used historically. With RDP 4, the RDP client does not
            perform any checks in order to verify the identity of the
            server it connects to. Since user credentials can be
            obtained using a man in the middle (MITM) attack, RDP4
            authentication is insecure and should generally not be used.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">RDP 5.1</b> authentication
            employs a server certificate for which the client possesses
            the public key. This way it is guaranteed that the server
            possess the corresponding private key. However, as this
            hard-coded private key became public some years ago, RDP 5.1
            authentication is also insecure.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b outputclass="bold">RDP 5.2 or later</b>
            authentication uses Enhanced RDP Security, which means that
            an external security protocol is used to secure the
            connection. RDP 4 and RDP 5.1 use Standard RDP Security. The
            VRDP server supports Enhanced RDP Security with TLS protocol
            and, as a part of the TLS handshake, sends the server
            certificate to the client.
          </p>
        <p>The <codeph>Security/Method</codeph> VRDE property sets the required security method, which is used for a
          connection. Valid values are as follows: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">Negotiate.</b> Both
                Enhanced (TLS) and Standard RDP Security connections are
                allowed. The security method is negotiated with the
                client. This is the default setting.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">RDP.</b> Only Standard RDP
                Security is accepted.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b outputclass="bold">TLS.</b> Only Enhanced RDP
                Security is accepted. The client must support TLS.
              </p>
            <p>
                The version of OpenSSL used by <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> supports
                TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, the following command enables a client to use either Standard or Enhanced RDP Security
          connection: </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">vboxmanage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> --vrde-property "Security/Method=negotiate"</pre>
        <p>If the <codeph>Security/Method</codeph> property is set to either Negotiate or TLS, the TLS protocol will be
          automatically used by the server, if the client supports TLS. However, in order to use TLS the server must
          possess the Server Certificate, the Server Private Key and the Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate. The
          following example shows how to generate a server certificate. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Create a CA self signed certificate. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -extensions v3_ca \
  -keyout ca_key_private.pem -out ca_cert.pem</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Generate a server private key and a request for signing. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">openssl genrsa -out server_key_private.pem
openssl req -new -key server_key_private.pem -out server_req.pem</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Generate the server certificate. </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server_req.pem \
  -CA ca_cert.pem -CAkey ca_key_private.pem -set_serial 01 -out server_cert.pem</pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The server must be configured to access the required files. For example: </p>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">vboxmanage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> \
  --vrde-property "Security/CACertificate=path/ca_cert.pem"</pre>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">vboxmanage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> \
  --vrde-property "Security/ServerCertificate=path/server_cert.pem"</pre>
        <pre xml:space="preserve">vboxmanage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> \
  --vrde-property "Security/ServerPrivateKey=path/server_key_private.pem"</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As the client that connects to the server determines what type of encryption will be used, with
        <userinput>rdesktop</userinput>, the Linux RDP viewer, use the <codeph>-4</codeph> or <codeph>-5</codeph>
      options. </p>
