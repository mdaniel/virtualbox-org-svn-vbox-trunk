  <title>Multiple Connections to the VRDP Server</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>The VRDP server of <ph conkeyref="vbox-conkeyref-phrases/product-name"/> supports multiple simultaneous
      connections to the same running VM from different clients. All connected clients see the same screen output and
      share a mouse pointer and keyboard focus. This is similar to several people using the same computer at the same
      time, taking turns at the keyboard. </p>
    <p>The following command enables multiple connection mode: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> --vrde-multi-con on</pre>
