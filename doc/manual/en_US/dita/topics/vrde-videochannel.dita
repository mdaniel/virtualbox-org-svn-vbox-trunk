  <title>VRDP Video Redirection</title>
  
  <body>
    <p>The VRDP server can redirect video streams from the guest to the RDP client. Video frames are compressed using
      the JPEG algorithm allowing a higher compression ratio than standard RDP bitmap compression methods. It is
      possible to increase the compression ratio by lowering the video quality. </p>
    <p>The VRDP server automatically detects video streams in a guest as frequently updated rectangular areas. As a
      result, this method works with any guest operating system without having to install additional software in the
      guest. In particular, the Guest Additions are not required. </p>
    <p>On the client side, however, currently only the Windows 7 Remote Desktop Connection client supports this feature.
      If a client does not support video redirection, the VRDP server falls back to regular bitmap updates. </p>
    <p>The following command enables video redirection: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> --vrde-video-channel on</pre>
    <p>The quality of the video is defined as a value from 10 to 100 percent, representing a JPEG compression level,
      where lower numbers mean lower quality but higher compression. The quality can be changed using the following
      command: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxManage modifyvm <varname>VM-name</varname> --vrde-video-channel-quality 75</pre>
