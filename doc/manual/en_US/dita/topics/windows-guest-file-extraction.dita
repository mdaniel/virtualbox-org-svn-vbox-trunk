                     <p>If you would like to install the files and drivers manually, you can extract the files from the
      Windows Guest Additions setup as follows: </p>
                     <pre xml:space="preserve">VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe /extract</pre>
                     <p>To explicitly extract the Windows Guest Additions for another platform than the current running
      one, such as 64-bit files on a 32-bit system, you must use the appropriate platform installer. Use
        <filepath>VBoxWindowsAdditions-x86.exe</filepath> or <filepath>VBoxWindowsAdditions-amd64.exe</filepath> with
      the <codeph>/extract</codeph> parameter. </p>
