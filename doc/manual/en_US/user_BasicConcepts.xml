  <title>Configuring Virtual Machines</title>

  <para>
    This chapter provides detailed steps for configuring an
    &product-name; virtual machine (VM). For an introduction to
    &product-name; and steps to get your first virtual machine running,
    see <xref linkend="Introduction" />.

    You have considerable latitude when deciding what virtual hardware
    to provide to the guest. Use virtual hardware to communicate with
    the host system or with other guests. For example, you can use
    virtual hardware in the following ways:

            Mac OS X is commercial, licensed software and contains
            <emphasis role="bold">both license and technical

          <para>
            These license restrictions are also enforced on a technical
            level. Mac OS X verifies that it is running on Apple
            hardware. Most DVDs that accompany Apple hardware check for

          Note that the boot order is changed during the preparation
          step, giving the virtual hard disk the highest priority. As
          this disk is normally empty before an automatic installation
          is started, the VM will instead boot from the virtual DVD
          drive as next available boot medium and the installation will
          start. If the virtual hard disk contains a bootable operating
          system, then the installation will not start. The boot order
          must be manually changed, by pressing F12 during the BIOS
          splash screen.

        As the activation mechanism of Microsoft Windows is sensitive to
        hardware changes, if you are changing hardware settings for a
        Windows guest, some of these changes may trigger a request for
        another activation with Microsoft.

          Initially you will normally have one such virtual disk, but as

      If you created your VM with an older version of &product-name;,

      have been attached. This might also apply if you selected an older
      operating system type when you created the VM. Since older
      operating systems do not support SATA without additional drivers,
      &product-name; will make sure that no such devices are present
      initially. See <xref linkend="harddiskcontrollers" />.

      &product-name; also provides a <emphasis>floppy

      When you first create a virtual machine, &product-name; by default
      enables one virtual network card and selects the Network Address
      Translation (NAT) mode for it. This way the guest can connect to
      the outside world using the host's networking and the outside

      This default setup is good for the majority of &product-name;
      users. However, &product-name; is extremely flexible in how it can

    <title>Serial Ports</title>

    <para>
      &product-name; supports the use of virtual serial ports in a
      virtual machine.
    </para>

    <para>
      Ever since the original IBM PC, personal computers have been
      equipped with one or two serial ports, also called COM ports by
      DOS and Windows. Serial ports were commonly used with modems, and
      some computer mice used to be connected to serial ports before USB
      became commonplace.
    </para>

    <para>
      While serial ports are no longer as common as they used to be,
      there are still some important uses left for them. For example,
      serial ports can be used to set up a primitive network over a
      null-modem cable, in case Ethernet is not available. Also, serial
      ports are indispensable for system programmers needing to do
      kernel debugging, since kernel debugging software usually
      interacts with developers over a serial port. With virtual serial
      ports, system programmers can do kernel debugging on a virtual
      machine instead of needing a real computer to connect to.
    </para>

    <para>
      If a virtual serial port is enabled, the guest operating system
      sees a standard 16550A compatible UART device. Other UART types
      can be configured using the <command>VBoxManage modifyvm</command>
      command. Both receiving and transmitting data is supported. How
      this virtual serial port is then connected to the host is
      configurable, and the details depend on your host operating
      system.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can use either the Settings tabs or the
      <command>VBoxManage</command> command to set up virtual serial
      ports. For the latter, see <xref linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm" />

        On Windows hosts, a kernel mode device driver provides USB proxy

        &product-name; to capture devices when they are plugged in, and
        a USB device driver to claim USB devices for a particular

    <title>Alternative Firmware (EFI)</title>

    <para>
      &product-name; includes experimental support for the Extensible
      Firmware Interface (EFI), which is a new industry standard
      intended to eventually replace the legacy BIOS as the primary
      interface for bootstrapping computers and certain system services
      later.
    </para>

    <para>
      By default, &product-name; uses the BIOS firmware for virtual
      machines. To use EFI for a given virtual machine, you can enable
      EFI in the machine's <emphasis role="bold">Settings</emphasis>
      dialog. See <xref linkend="settings-motherboard"/>. Alternatively,
      use the <command>VBoxManage</command> command line interface as
      follows:
    </para>

<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --firmware efi</screen>

    <para>
      To switch back to using the BIOS:
    </para>

<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --firmware bios</screen>

    <para>
      One notable user of EFI is Apple Mac OS X. More recent Linux
      versions and Windows releases, starting with Vista, also offer
      special versions that can be booted using EFI.
    </para>

    <para>
      Another possible use of EFI in &product-name; is development and
      testing of EFI applications, without booting any OS.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that the &product-name; EFI support is experimental and will
      be enhanced as EFI matures and becomes more widespread. Mac OS X,
      Linux, and newer Windows guests are known to work fine. Windows 7
      guests are unable to boot with the &product-name; EFI
      implementation.

      <title>Video Modes in EFI</title>

      <para>
        EFI provides two distinct video interfaces: GOP (Graphics Output
        Protocol) and UGA (Universal Graphics Adapter). Modern operating
        systems, such as Mac OS X, generally use GOP, while some older
        ones still use UGA. &product-name; provides a configuration
        option to control the graphics resolution for both interfaces,
        making the difference mostly irrelevant for users.
      </para>

      <para>
        The default resolution is 1024x768. To select a graphics
        resolution for EFI, use the following
