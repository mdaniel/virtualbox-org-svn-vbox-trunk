  <title>Guest Additions</title>

  <para>The previous chapter covered getting started with VirtualBox and
  installing operating systems in a virtual machine. For any serious and
  interactive use, the VirtualBox Guest Additions will make your life much
  easier by providing closer integration between host and guest and improving
  the interactive performance of guest systems. This chapter describes the
  Guest Additions in detail.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>As mentioned in <xref linkend="virtintro" />, the Guest Additions
    are designed to be installed <emphasis>inside</emphasis> a virtual machine
    after the guest operating system has been installed. They consist of
    device drivers and system applications that optimize the guest operating
    system for better performance and usability. Please see <xref
    linkend="guestossupport" /> for details on what guest operating systems
    are fully supported with Guest Additions by VirtualBox.</para>

    <para>The VirtualBox Guest Additions for all supported guest operating
    systems are provided as a single CD-ROM image file which is called
    <computeroutput>VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</computeroutput>. This image file
    is located in the installation directory of VirtualBox. To install the
    Guest Additions for a particular VM, you mount this ISO file in your VM as
    a virtual CD-ROM and install from there.</para>

    <para>The Guest Additions offer the following features:<glosslist>
        <glossentry>
          <glossterm>Mouse pointer integration</glossterm>

          <glossdef>
            <para>To overcome the limitations for mouse support that were
            described in <xref linkend="keyb_mouse_normal" />, this provides
            you with seamless mouse support. You will only have one mouse
            pointer and pressing the Host key is no longer required to "free"
            the mouse from being captured by the guest OS. To make this work,
            a special mouse driver is installed in the guest that communicates
            with the "real" mouse driver on your host and moves the guest
            mouse pointer accordingly.</para>
          </glossdef>
        </glossentry>

        <glossentry>
          <glossterm>Shared folders</glossterm>

          <glossdef>
            <para>These provide an easy way to exchange files between the host
            and the guest. Much like ordinary Windows network shares, you can
            tell VirtualBox to treat a certain host directory as a shared
            folder, and VirtualBox will make it available to the guest
            operating system as a network share, irrespective of whether guest
            actually has a network. For details, please refer to <xref
            linkend="sharedfolders" />.</para>
          </glossdef>
        </glossentry>

        <glossentry>
          <glossterm>Better video support</glossterm>

          <glossdef>
            <para>While the virtual graphics card which VirtualBox emulates
            for any guest operating system provides all the basic features,
            the custom video drivers that are installed with the Guest
            Additions provide you with extra high and non-standard video modes
            as well as accelerated video performance.</para>

            <para>In addition, with Windows, Linux and Solaris guests, you can
            resize the virtual machine's window if the Guest Additions are
            installed. The video resolution in the guest will be automatically
            adjusted (as if you had manually entered an arbitrary resolution
            in the guest's display settings). Please see <xref
            linkend="intro-resize-window" /> also.</para>

            <para>Finally, if the Guest Additions are installed, 3D graphics
            and 2D video for guest applications can be accelerated; see <xref
            linkend="guestadd-video" />.</para>

        <glossentry>
          <glossterm>Seamless windows</glossterm>

          <glossdef>
            <para>With this feature, the individual windows that are displayed
            on the desktop of the virtual machine can be mapped on the host's
            desktop, as if the underlying application was actually running on
            the host. See <xref linkend="seamlesswindows" /> for
            details.</para>
          </glossdef>
        </glossentry>

        <glossentry>
          <glossterm>Generic host/guest communication channels</glossterm>

          <glossdef>
            <para>The Guest Additions enable you to control and monitor guest
            execution in ways other than those mentioned above. The so-called
            "guest properties" provide a generic string-based mechanism to
            exchange data bits between a guest and a host, some of which have
            special meanings for controlling and monitoring the guest; see
            <xref linkend="guestadd-guestprops" /> for details.</para>

            <para>Additionally, applications can be started in a guest from
            the host; see <xref linkend="guestadd-guestcontrol" />.</para>
          </glossdef>
        </glossentry>

        <glossentry>
          <glossterm>Time synchronization</glossterm>

          <glossdef>
            <para>With the Guest Additions installed, VirtualBox can ensure
            that the guest's system time is better synchronized with that of
            the host.</para>

            <para>For various reasons, the time in the guest might run at a
            slightly different rate than the time on the host. The host could
            be receiving updates via NTP and its own time might not run
            linearly. A VM could also be paused, which stops the flow of time
            in the guest for a shorter or longer period of time. When the wall
            clock time between the guest and host only differs slightly, the
            time synchronization service attempts to gradually and smoothly
            adjust the guest time in small increments to either "catch up" or
            "lose" time. When the difference is too great (e.g., a VM paused
            for hours or restored from saved state), the guest time is changed
            immediately, without a gradual adjustment.</para>

            <para>The Guest Additions will re-synchronize the time regularly.
            See <xref linkend="changetimesync" /> for how to configure the
            parameters of the time synchronization mechanism.</para>
          </glossdef>
        </glossentry>

        <glossentry>
          <glossterm>Shared clipboard</glossterm>

          <glossdef>
            <para>With the Guest Additions installed, the clipboard of the
            guest operating system can optionally be shared with your host
            operating system; see <xref linkend="generalsettings" />.</para>
          </glossdef>
        </glossentry>

        <glossentry>
          <glossterm>Automated logons (credentials passing)</glossterm>

          <glossdef>
            <para>For details, please see <xref linkend="autologon" />.</para>
          </glossdef>
        </glossentry>
      </glosslist></para>

    <para>Each version of VirtualBox, even minor releases, ship with their own
    version of the Guest Additions. While the interfaces through which the
    VirtualBox core communicates with the Guest Additions are kept stable so
    that Guest Additions already installed in a VM should continue to work
    when VirtualBox is upgraded on the host, for best results, it is
    recommended to keep the Guest Additions at the same version.</para>

    <para>Starting with VirtualBox 3.1, the Windows and Linux Guest Additions
    therefore check automatically whether they have to be updated. If the host
    is running a newer VirtualBox version than the Guest Additions, a
    notification with further instructions is displayed in the guest.</para>

    <para>To disable this update check for the Guest Additions of a given
    virtual machine, set the value of its
    <computeroutput>/VirtualBox/GuestAdd/CheckHostVersion</computeroutput>
    guest property to <computeroutput>0</computeroutput>; see <xref
    linkend="guestadd-guestprops" /> for details.</para>

        <title>Installation</title>

        <para>In the "Devices" menu in the virtual machine's menu bar,
        VirtualBox has a handy menu item named "Insert Guest Additions CD image",
        which mounts the Guest Additions ISO file inside your virtual machine.
        A Windows guest should then automatically start the Guest Additions
        installer, which installs the Guest Additions into your Windows
        guest. Other guest operating systems (or if automatic start of
        software on CD is disabled) need manual start of the installer.</para>

        <note>
          <para>For the basic Direct3D acceleration to work in a Windows guest,
          you have to install the WDDM video driver available for Windows Vista
          or higher.<footnote><para>An experimental WDDM driver was
          added with VirtualBox 4.1.</para></footnote> For Windows 8 and higher
          only the WDDM Direct3D video driver is available. For basic Direct3D
          acceleration to work in Windows XP guests, you have to install the

        <title>Unattended Installation</title>

        <para>As a prerequisite for avoid popups while performing an
        unattended installation of the VirtualBox Guest Additions, the code
        signing certificates used to sign the drivers needs to be installed in
        the right certificates stores in the guest system.  Failing to do this
        will cause a typical windows installation to pop up a dialog asking
        whether its allowable to install each driver.</para>

        <note><para>On some Windows versions like Windows 2000 and Windows XP the user intervention
        popups mentioned above always will be displayed, even after importing the Oracle certificates.</para></note>

        <para>Since VirtualBox 4.2 installing those code signing certificates
        on a Windows guest can be done in an automated fashion using the
        <computeroutput>VBoxCertUtil.exe</computeroutput> utility found on the Guest
        Additions installation CD in the <computeroutput>cert</computeroutput>

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Prior to VirtualBox 4.2 the code signing certificates need to be imported in more manual style
        using the <computeroutput>certutil.exe</computeroutput> utility, which is shipped since Windows
        Vista.  For Windows versions before Vista you need to download and install <computeroutput>certutil.exe</computeroutput>
        manually. Since the certificates are not accompanied on the VirtualBox Guest Additions CD-ROM
        prior to 4.2, these need to get extracted from a signed VirtualBox executable first.</para>

      <title>Guest Additions for Linux</title>

      <para>Like the Windows Guest Additions, the VirtualBox Guest Additions
      for Linux are a set of device drivers and system applications which may
      be installed in the guest operating system.</para>

      <para>The following Linux distributions are officially supported:</para>

      <para>Many other distributions are known to work with the Guest
      Additions.</para>

      <para>The version of the Linux kernel supplied by default in SUSE and
      openSUSE 10.2, Ubuntu 6.10 (all versions) and Ubuntu 6.06 (server
      edition) contains a bug which can cause it to crash during startup when
      it is run in a virtual machine. The Guest Additions work in those
      distributions.</para>

      <para>Note that some Linux distributions already come with all or part of
      the VirtualBox Guest Additions. You may choose to keep the distribution's
      version of the Guest Additions but these are often not up to date and
      limited in functionality, so we recommend replacing them with the
      Guest Additions that come with VirtualBox. The VirtualBox Linux Guest
      Additions installer tries to detect existing installation and replace
      them but depending on how the distribution integrates the Guest
      Additions, this may require some manual interaction. It is highly
      recommended to take a snapshot of the virtual machine before replacing
      pre-installed Guest Additions.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Installing the Linux Guest Additions</title>

        <para>The VirtualBox Guest Additions for Linux are provided on the
        same virtual CD-ROM file as the Guest Additions for Windows described
        above. They also come with an installation program guiding you through
        the setup process, although, due to the significant differences between
        Linux distributions, installation may be slightly more complex.</para>

        <para>Installation generally involves the following steps:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Before installing the Guest Additions, you will have to
            prepare your guest system for building external kernel modules.
            This works similarly as described in <xref
            linkend="externalkernelmodules" />, except that this step must now
            be performed in your Linux <emphasis>guest</emphasis> instead of
            on a Linux host system, as described there.</para>

            <para>If you suspect that something has gone wrong, check that your

        <title>Graphics and mouse integration</title>

        <para>In Linux and Solaris guests, VirtualBox graphics and mouse
        integration goes through the X Window System.  VirtualBox can use
        the X.Org variant of the system (or XFree86 version 4.3 which is
        identical to the first X.Org release). During the installation process,
        the X.Org display server will be set up to use the graphics and mouse
        drivers which come with the Guest Additions.</para>

        <para>After installing the Guest Additions into a fresh installation of
        a supported Linux distribution or Solaris system (many unsupported
        systems will work correctly too), the guest's graphics
        mode will change to fit the size of the VirtualBox window
        on the host when it is resized.  You can also ask the guest system to
        switch to a particular resolution by sending a "video mode hint" using
        the <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> tool.</para>

        <para>Multiple guest monitors are supported in guests using the X.Org
        server version 1.3 (which is part of release 7.3 of the X Window System
        version 11) or a later version. The layout of the guest screens can
        be adjusted as needed using the tools which come with the guest
        operating system.</para>

        <para>If you want to understand more about the details of how the
        X.Org drivers are set up (in particular if you wish to use them in a
        setting which our installer doesn't handle correctly), you should read
        <xref linkend="guestxorgsetup" />.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Updating the Linux Guest Additions</title>

        <para>The Guest Additions can simply be updated by going through the
        installation procedure again with an updated CD-ROM image. This will
        replace the drivers with updated versions. You should reboot after
        updating the Guest Additions.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Uninstalling the Linux Guest Additions</title>

        <para>If you have a version of the Guest Additions installed on your
        virtual machine and wish to remove it without installing new ones, you
        can do so by inserting the Guest Additions CD image into the virtual
        CD-ROM drive as described above and running the installer for the
        current Guest Additions with the "uninstall" parameter from the path
        that the CD image is mounted on in the guest: <screen>sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run uninstall</screen></para>

        <para>While this will normally work without issues, you may need to do some
        manual cleanup of the guest (particularly of the XFree86Config or
        xorg.conf file) in some cases, particularly if the Additions version
        installed or the guest operating system were very old, or if you made
        your own changes to the Guest Additions setup after you installed
        them.</para>

        <para>Starting with version 3.1.0, you can uninstall the Additions by
        invoking <screen>/opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-@VBOX_VERSION_STRING@/uninstall.sh</screen>Please
        replace

      <title>Guest Additions for OS/2</title>

      <para>VirtualBox also ships with a set of drivers that improve running
      OS/2 in a virtual machine. Due to restrictions of OS/2 itself, this
      variant of the Guest Additions has a limited feature set; see <xref

      <para>The OS/2 Guest Additions are provided on the same ISO CD-ROM as

  <sect1 id="sharedfolders">
    <title>Shared folders</title>

    <para>With the "shared folders" feature of VirtualBox, you can access
    files of your host system from within the guest system. This is similar
    how you would use network shares in Windows networks -- except that shared
    folders do not need require networking, only the Guest Additions. Shared
    Folders are supported with Windows (2000 or newer), Linux and Solaris
    guests.</para>

    <para>Shared folders must physically reside on the
    <emphasis>host</emphasis> and are then shared with the guest, which uses a
    special file system driver in the Guest Addition to talk to the host. For
    Windows guests, shared folders are implemented as a pseudo-network
    redirector; for Linux and Solaris guests, the Guest Additions provide a
    virtual file system.</para>

    <para>To share a host folder with a virtual machine in VirtualBox, you
    must specify the path of that folder and choose for it a "share name" that
    the guest can use to access it. Hence, first create the shared folder on
    the host; then, within the guest, connect to it.</para>

    <para>There are several ways in which shared folders can be set up for a
    particular virtual machine:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>In the window of a running VM, you can select "Shared folders"
          from the "Devices" menu, or click on the folder icon on the status
          bar in the bottom right corner.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If a VM is not currently running, you can configure shared
          folders in each virtual machine's "Settings" dialog.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>From the command line, you can create shared folders using
          VBoxManage, as follows: <screen>VBoxManage sharedfolder add "VM name" --name "sharename" --hostpath "C:\test"</screen></para>

          <para>See <xref linkend="vboxmanage-sharedfolder" /> for
          details.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>There are two types of shares:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>VM shares which are only available to the VM for which they have
        been defined;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>transient VM shares, which can be added and removed at runtime
        and do not persist after a VM has stopped; for these, add the
        <computeroutput>--transient</computeroutput> option to the above
        command line.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Shared folders have read/write access to the files at the host path
    by default. To restrict the guest to have read-only access, create a
    read-only shared folder. This can either be achieved using the GUI or by
    appending the parameter <computeroutput>--readonly</computeroutput> when
    creating the shared folder with VBoxManage.</para>

    <para>Starting with version 4.0, VirtualBox shared folders also support
    symbolic links (<emphasis role="bold">symlinks</emphasis>), under the
    following conditions:<orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The host operating system must support symlinks (i.e. a Mac,

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>For security reasons the guest OS is not allowed to create
          symlinks by default. If you trust the guest OS to not abuse the
          functionality, you can enable creation of symlinks for "sharename"
          with:

      <para>Starting with version 4.0, VirtualBox can mount shared folders
      automatically, at your option. If automatic mounting is enabled for a
      specific shared folder, the Guest Additions will automatically mount
      that folder as soon as a user logs into the guest OS. The details depend

    <title>Drag and Drop</title>

    <para>Starting with version 5.0, VirtualBox supports to drag and drop content
    from the host to the guest and vice versa. For this to work the latest Guest
    Additions must be installed on the guest.</para>

    <para>Drag and drop transparently allows copying or opening files, directories
    and even certain clipboard formats from one end to the other, e.g. from the
    host to the guest or from the guest to the host. One then can perform drag and
    drop operations between the host and a VM as it would be a native drag and drop
    operation on the host OS.</para>

    <para>At the moment drag and drop is implemented for Windows- and X-Windows-based
    systems, both, on host and guest side. As X-Windows sports different drag and drop
    protocols only the most used one, XDND, is supported for now. Applications using
    other protocols (such as Motif or OffiX) will not be recognized by VirtualBox.</para>

    <para>In context of using drag and drop the origin of the data is called
    <emphasis role="bold">source</emphasis>, that is, where the actual data comes
    from and is specified. On the other hand there is the
    <emphasis role="bold">target</emphasis>, which specifies where the data from
    the source should go to. Transferring data from the source to the target can
    be done in various ways, e.g. copying, moving or linking.<footnote><para>At
    the moment only copying of data is supported. Moving or linking is not yet
    implemented.</para></footnote></para>

    <para>When transferring data from the host to the guest OS, the host in
    this case is the source, whereas the guest OS is the target. However, when
    doing it the other way around, that is, transferring data from the guest OS
    to the host, the guest OS this time became the source and the host is the
    target.</para>

    <para>For security reasons drag and drop can be configured at runtime on a
    per-VM basis either using the "Drag and Drop" menu item in the "Devices" menu
    of the virtual machine or VBoxManage. The following four modes are
    available:</para>

    <title>Guest properties</title>

    <para>Starting with version 2.1, VirtualBox allows for requesting certain

    <para>To accomplish this, VirtualBox establishes a private communication
    channel between the VirtualBox Guest Additions and the host, and software

    purposes. Guest properties are simply string keys to which a value is
    attached. They can be set (written to) by either the host and the guest,
    and they can also be read from both sides.</para>

    <para>In addition to establishing the general mechanism of reading and
    writing values, a set of predefined guest properties is automatically
    maintained by the VirtualBox Guest Additions to allow for retrieving
    interesting guest data such as the guest's exact operating system and
    service pack level, the installed version of the Guest Additions, users
    that are currently logged into the guest OS, network statistics and more.
    These predefined properties are all prefixed with

    <title>Guest control</title>

    <para>Starting with version 3.2, the Guest Additions of VirtualBox allow
    starting applications inside a VM from the host system.</para>

    <para>For this to work, the application needs to be installed inside the
    guest; no additional software needs to be installed on the host.
    Additionally, text mode output (to stdout and stderr) can be shown on the
    host for further processing along with options to specify user credentials
    and a timeout value (in milliseconds) to limit time the application is
    able to run.</para>

    <para>This feature can be used to automate deployment of software within
    the guest.</para>

    <para>Starting with version 4.0, the Guest Additions for Windows allow for
    automatic updating (only already installed Guest Additions 4.0 or later).
    Also, copying files from host to the guest as well as remotely creating
    guest directories is available.</para>

    <para>To use these features, use the VirtualBox command line, see <xref

    <title>Memory overcommitment</title>

    <para>In server environments with many VMs; the Guest Additions can be
    used to share physical host memory between several VMs, reducing the total
    amount of memory in use by the VMs. If memory usage is the limiting factor
    and CPU resources are still available, this can help with packing more VMs
    on each host.</para>

    <sect2 id="guestadd-balloon">
      <title>Memory ballooning</title>

      <para>Starting with version 3.2, the Guest Additions of VirtualBox can
      change the amount of host memory that a VM uses while the machine is
      running. Because of how this is implemented, this feature is called
      "memory ballooning".</para>

      <note>
        <para>VirtualBox supports memory ballooning only on 64-bit hosts, and
        it is not supported on Mac OS X hosts.</para>
      </note>

      <note>
        <para>Memory ballooning does not work with large pages enabled. To
        turn off large pages support for a VM, run
        <computeroutput>VBoxManage modifyvm &lt;VM name&gt; --largepages off</computeroutput>
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>Normally, to change the amount of memory allocated to a virtual
      machine, one has to shut down the virtual machine entirely and modify
      its settings. With memory ballooning, memory that was allocated for a
      virtual machine can be given to another virtual machine without having
      to shut the machine down.</para>

      <para>When memory ballooning is requested, the VirtualBox Guest
      Additions (which run inside the guest) allocate physical memory from the
      guest operating system on the kernel level and lock this memory down in
      the guest. This ensures that the guest will not use that memory any
      longer: no guest applications can allocate it, and the guest kernel will
      not use it either. VirtualBox can then re-use this memory and give it to
      another virtual machine.</para>

      <para>The memory made available through the ballooning mechanism is only
      available for re-use by VirtualBox. It is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      returned as free memory to the host. Requesting balloon memory from a
      running guest will therefore not increase the amount of free,
      unallocated memory on the host. Effectively, memory ballooning is
      therefore a memory overcommitment mechanism for multiple virtual
      machines while they are running. This can be useful to temporarily start
      another machine, or in more complicated environments, for sophisticated
      memory management of many virtual machines that may be running in
      parallel depending on how memory is used by the guests.</para>

      <para>At this time, memory ballooning is only supported through
      VBoxManage. Use the following command to increase or decrease the size
      of the memory balloon within a running virtual machine that has Guest
      Additions installed: <screen>VBoxManage controlvm "VM name" guestmemoryballoon &lt;n&gt;</screen>where
      <computeroutput>"VM name"</computeroutput> is the name or UUID of the
      virtual machine in question and
      <computeroutput>&lt;n&gt;</computeroutput> is the amount of memory to
      allocate from the guest in megabytes. See <xref
      linkend="vboxmanage-controlvm" /> for more information.</para>

      <para>You can also set a default balloon that will automatically be
      requested from the VM every time after it has started up with the
      following command: <screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --guestmemoryballoon &lt;n&gt;</screen></para>

      <para>By default, no balloon memory is allocated. This is a VM setting,
      like other <computeroutput>modifyvm</computeroutput> settings, and
      therefore can only be set while the machine is shut down; see <xref
      linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm" />.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="guestadd-pagefusion">
      <title>Page Fusion</title>

      <para>Whereas memory ballooning simply reduces the amount of RAM that is
      available to a VM, Page Fusion works differently: it avoids memory
      duplication between several similar running VMs.</para>

      <para>In a server environment running several similar VMs (e.g. with
      identical operating systems) on the same host, lots of memory pages are
      identical. VirtualBox's Page Fusion technology, introduced with
      VirtualBox 3.2, is a novel technique to efficiently identify these
      identical memory pages and share them between multiple VMs.<note>
          <para>VirtualBox supports Page Fusion only on 64-bit hosts, and it
          is not supported on Mac OS X hosts. Page Fusion currently works only
          with Windows guests (2000 and later).</para>
        </note></para>

      <para>The more similar the VMs on a given host are, the more efficiently
      Page Fusion can reduce the amount of host memory that is in use. It
      therefore works best if all VMs on a host run identical operating
      systems (e.g. Windows XP Service Pack 2). Instead of having a complete
      copy of each operating system in each VM, Page Fusion identifies the
      identical memory pages in use by these operating systems and eliminates
      the duplicates, sharing host memory between several machines
      ("deduplication"). If a VM tries to modify a page that has been shared
      with other VMs, a new page is allocated again for that VM with a copy of
      the shared page ("copy on write"). All this is fully transparent to the
      virtual machine.</para>

      <para>You may be familiar with this kind of memory overcommitment from
      other hypervisor products, which call this feature "page sharing" or
      "same page merging". However, Page Fusion differs significantly from
      those other solutions, whose approaches have several
      drawbacks:<orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Traditional hypervisors scan <emphasis>all</emphasis> guest
            memory and compute checksums (hashes) for every single memory
            page. Then, they look for pages with identical hashes and compare
            the entire content of those pages; if two pages produce the same
            hash, it is very likely that the pages are identical in content.
            This, of course, can take rather long, especially if the system is
            not idling. As a result, the additional memory only becomes
            available after a significant amount of time (this can be hours or
            even days!). Even worse, this kind of page sharing algorithm
            generally consumes significant CPU resources and increases the
            virtualization overhead by 10-20%.</para>

            <para>Page Fusion in VirtualBox uses logic in the VirtualBox Guest
            Additions to quickly identify memory cells that are most likely
            identical across VMs. It can therefore achieve most of the
            possible savings of page sharing almost immediately and with
            almost no overhead.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Page Fusion is also much less likely to be confused by
            identical memory that it will eliminate just to learn seconds
            later that the memory will now change and having to perform a
            highly expensive and often service-disrupting reallocation.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist></para>

      <para>At this time, Page Fusion can only be controlled with VBoxManage,
      and only while a VM is shut down. To enable Page Fusion for a VM, use
      the following command:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --pagefusion on</screen></para>

      <para>You can observe Page Fusion operation using some metrics.
      <computeroutput>RAM/VMM/Shared</computeroutput> shows the total amount
      of fused pages, whereas the per-VM metric
      <computeroutput>Guest/RAM/Usage/Shared</computeroutput> will return the
      amount of fused memory for a given VM. Please refer to <xref
        linkend="metrics" /> for information on how to query metrics.</para>

      <note><para>Enabling Page Fusion might indirectly increase the chances
      for malicious guests to successfully attack other VMs running on the
      same host, see <xref linkend="pot-insecure"/>.</para></note>
