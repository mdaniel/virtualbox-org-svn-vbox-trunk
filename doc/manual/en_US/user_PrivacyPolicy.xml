  <title>VirtualBox privacy information</title>

  <para>Version 5, Dec 13, 2012</para>

  <para>The Oracle Privacy Policies posted on
  <ulink url="http://www.oracle.com/html/privacy.html">http://www.oracle.com/html/privacy.html</ulink>
  apply to your personal data collected and used by Oracle. The following
  privacy information describes in more detail which information is exchanged
  between the VirtualBox application and Oracle, and which information is
  collected by the virtualbox.org website.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">§ 1 virtualbox.org.</emphasis> The
  "virtualbox.org" website logs anonymous usage information such as your IP
  address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of
  visit and number of page views while you visit (collectively, "anonymous
  data"). In addition, but only if you choose to register, the website's bug
  tracking and forum services store the data you choose to reveal upon
  registration, such as your user name and contact information.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">§ 2 Cookies.</emphasis> The virtualbox.org
  website, the bug tracker and the forum services use cookies to identify and
  track the visiting web browser and, if you have registered, to facilitate
  login. Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. While you can
  still visit the website with cookies disabled, logging into the bug tracker
  and forum services will most likely not work without them.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">§ 3 VirtualBox registration process.</emphasis>
  The VirtualBox application may ask that the user optionally register with
  Oracle. If you choose to register, your name, e-mail address, country and
  company will be submitted to Oracle and stored together with the IP address
  of the submitter as well as product version and platform being used.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">§ 4 Update notifications.</emphasis> The
  VirtualBox application may contact Oracle to find out whether a new version
  of VirtualBox has been released and notify the user if that is the case. In
  the process, anonymous data such as your IP address and a non-identifying
  counter, together with the product version and the platform being used, is
  sent so that the server can find out whether an update is available. By
  default, this check is performed once a day. You change this interval or
  disable these checks altogether in the VirtualBox preferences.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">§ 5 Usage of personal information.</emphasis>
  Oracle may use anonymous and personal data collected by the means above for
  statistical purposes as well as to automatically inform you about new
  notices related to your posts on the bug tracker and forum services, to
  administer the website and to contact you due to technical issues. Oracle
  may also inform you about new product releases related to VirtualBox.</para>

  <para>In no event will personal data without your express consent be
  provided to any third parties, unless Oracle may be required to do so by law
  or in connection with legal proceedings.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">§ 6 Updates.</emphasis> Oracle may update the
  privacy policy at any time by posting a new version at
  <ulink url="http://www.oracle.com/html/privacy.html">http://www.oracle.com/html/privacy.html</ulink> and the privacy information will be kept up to date
  in the documentation which comes with the VirtualBox application. You
  should check these places occasionally to ensure you are happy with any
  changes.</para>
