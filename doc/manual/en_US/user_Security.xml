    <title>General Security Principles</title>

    <para>The following principles are fundamental to using any application
      securely.

          <glossdef>
            <para>
              One of the principles of good security practise is to keep all
              software versions and patches up to date. Activate the VirtualBox
              update notification to get notified when a new VirtualBox release
              is available. When updating VirtualBox, do not forget to update
              the Guest Additions. Keep the host operating system as well as the
              guest operating system up to date.

          <glossdef>
            <para>
              Use proper means, for instance a firewall, to protect your computer
              and your guest(s) from accesses from the outside. Choosing the proper
              networking mode for VMs helps to separate host networking from the
              guest and vice versa.

          <glossterm>Follow the Principle of Least Privilege</glossterm>
          <glossdef>
            <para>
              The principle of least privilege states that users should be given the
              least amount of privilege necessary to perform their jobs. Always execute VirtualBox
              as a regular user. We strongly discourage anyone from executing
              VirtualBox with system privileges.
            </para>
            <para>
              Choose restrictive permissions when creating configuration files,
              for instance when creating /etc/default/virtualbox, see
              <xref linkend="linux_install_opts"/>. Mode 0600 would be preferred.

            <para>
              System security builds on three pillars: good security protocols, proper
              system configuration and system monitoring. Auditing and reviewing audit
              records address the third requirement. Each component within a system
              has some degree of monitoring capability. Follow audit advice in this
              document and regularly monitor audit records.

    <sect2>
      <title>Installation Overview</title>
      <para>
        The VirtualBox base package should be downloaded only from a trusted source,
        for instance the official website
        <ulink url="http://www.virtualbox.org">http://www.virtualbox.org</ulink>.
        The integrity of the package should be verified with the provided SHA256
        checksum which can be found on the official website.
      </para>
      <para>
        General VirtualBox installation instructions for the supported hosts
        can be found in <xref linkend="installation"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
        On Windows hosts, the installer allows for disabling USB support, support
        for bridged networking, support for host-only networking and the Python
        language bindings, see <xref linkend="installation_windows"/>.
        All these features are enabled by default but disabling some
        of them could be appropriate if the corresponding functionality is not
        required by any virtual machine. The Python language bindings are only
        required if the VirtualBox API is to be used by external Python
        applications. In particular USB support and support
        for the two networking modes require the installation of Windows kernel
        drivers on the host. Therefore disabling those selected features can
        not only be used to restrict the user to certain functionality but
        also to minimize the surface provided to a potential attacker.     </para>
      <para>
        The general case is to install the complete VirtualBox package. The
        installation must be done with system privileges. All VirtualBox binaries
        should be executed as a regular user and never as a privileged user.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Oracle VM VirtualBox extension pack provides additional features
        and must be downloaded and installed separately, see
        <xref linkend="intro-installing"/>. As for the base package, the SHA256
        checksum of the extension pack should be verified. As the installation
        requires system privileges, VirtualBox will ask for the system
        password during the installation of the extension pack.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Post Installation Configuration</title>
      <para>
        Normally there is no post installation configuration of VirtualBox components
        required. However, on Solaris and Linux hosts it is necessary to configure
        the proper permissions for users executing VMs and who should be able to
        access certain host resources. For instance, Linux users must be member of
        the <emphasis>vboxusers</emphasis> group to be able to pass USB devices to a
        guest. If a serial host interface should be accessed from a VM, the proper
        permissions must be granted to the user to be able to access that device.
        The same applies to other resources like raw partitions, DVD/CD drives
        and sound devices.

    <title>Security Features</title>
    <para>This section outlines the specific security mechanisms offered
      by VirtualBox.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>The Security Model</title>
      <para>
        One property of virtual machine monitors (VMMs) like VirtualBox is to encapsulate
        a guest by executing it in a protected environment, a virtual machine,
        running as a user process on the host operating system. The guest cannot
        communicate directly with the hardware or other computers but only through
        the VMM. The VMM provides emulated physical resources and devices to the
        guest which are accessed by the guest operating system to perform the required
        tasks. The VM settings control the resources provided to the guest, for example
        the amount of guest memory or the number of guest processors, (see
        <xref linkend="generalsettings"/>) and the enabled features for that guest
        (for example remote control, certain screen settings and others).
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Secure Configuration of Virtual Machines</title>
      <para>
        Several aspects of a virtual machine configuration are subject to security
        considerations.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Networking</title>
        <para>
          The default networking mode for VMs is NAT which means that
          the VM acts like a computer behind a router, see
          <xref linkend="network_nat"/>. The guest is part of a private
          subnet belonging to this VM and the guest IP is not visible
          from the outside. This networking mode works without
          any additional setup and is sufficient for many purposes.
        </para>
        <para>
          If bridged networking is used, the VM acts like a computer inside
          the same network as the host, see <xref linkend="network_bridged"/>.
          In this case, the guest has the same network access as the host and
          a firewall might be necessary to protect other computers on the
          subnet from a potential malicious guest as well as to protect the
          guest from a direct access from other computers. In some cases it is
          worth considering using a forwarding rule for a specific port in NAT
          mode instead of using bridged networking.
        </para>
        <para>
          Some setups do not require a VM to be connected to the public network
          at all. Internal networking (see <xref linkend="network_internal"/>)
          or host-only networking (see <xref linkend="network_hostonly"/>)
          are often sufficient to connect VMs among each other or to connect
          VMs only with the host but not with the public network.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>VRDP remote desktop authentication</title>
        <para>When using the VirtualBox extension pack provided by Oracle
          for VRDP remote desktop support, you can optionally use various
          methods to configure RDP authentication. The "null" method is
          very insecure and should be avoided in a public network.
          See <xref linkend="vbox-auth" /> for details.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="security_clipboard">
        <title>Clipboard</title>
        <para>
          The shared clipboard allows users to share data between the host and
          the guest. Enabling the clipboard in "Bidirectional" mode allows
          the guest to read and write the host clipboard. The "Host to guest"
          mode and the "Guest to host" mode limit the access to one
          direction. If the guest is able to access the host clipboard it
          can also potentially access sensitive data from the host which is
          shared over the clipboard.
        </para>
        <para>
          If the guest is able to read from and/or write to the host clipboard
          then a remote user connecting to the guest over the network will also
          gain this ability, which may not be desirable. As a consequence, the
          shared clipboard is disabled for new machines.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Shared folders</title>
        <para>If any host folder is shared with the guest then a remote
          user connected to the guest over the network can access
          these files too as the folder sharing mechanism cannot be
          selectively disabled for remote users.

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>CD/DVD passthrough</title>
        <para>Enabling CD/DVD passthrough allows the guest to perform advanced
          operations on the CD/DVD drive, see <xref linkend="storage-cds"/>.
          This could induce a security risk as a guest could overwrite data
          on a CD/DVD medium.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>USB passthrough</title>
        <para>
          Passing USB devices to the guest provides the guest full access
          to these devices, see <xref linkend="settings-usb"/>. For instance,
          in addition to reading and writing the content of the partitions
          of an external USB disk the guest will be also able to read and
          write the partition table and hardware data of that disk.

          <para>When teleporting a machine, the data stream through which the
          machine's memory contents are transferred from one host to another
          is not encrypted. A third party with access to the network through
          which the data is transferred could therefore intercept that
          data. An SSH tunnel could be used to secure the connection between
          the two hosts. But when considering teleporting a VM over an untrusted
          network the first question to answer is how both VMs can securely

          <para>When Page Fusion (see <xref linkend="guestadd-pagefusion"/>)

          a malicious guest to determine the address space layout (i.e. where
          DLLs are typically loaded) of one other VM running on the same host.
          This information leak in it self is harmless, however the malicious
          guest may use it to optimize attack against that VM via unrelated
          attack vectors.  It is recommended to only enable Page Fusion if you
