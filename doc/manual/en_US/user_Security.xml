    <title>General Security Principles</title>

    <para>
      The following principles are fundamental to using any application
      securely.

          <emphasis role="strong">Keep software up to date</emphasis>.
          One of the principles of good security practise is to keep all
          software versions and patches up to date. Activate the
          &product-name; update notification to get notified when a new
          &product-name; release is available. When updating
          &product-name;, do not forget to update the Guest Additions.
          Keep the host operating system as well as the guest operating
          system up to date.

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong">Restrict network access to critical
          services.</emphasis> Use proper means, for instance a
          firewall, to protect your computer and your guests from
          accesses from the outside. Choosing the proper networking mode
          for VMs helps to separate host networking from the guest and
          vice versa.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong">Follow the principle of least
          privilege.</emphasis> The principle of least privilege states
          that users should be given the least amount of privilege
          necessary to perform their jobs. Always execute &product-name;
          as a regular user. We strongly discourage anyone from
          executing &product-name; with system privileges.
        </para>

        <para>
          Choose restrictive permissions when creating configuration
          files, for instance when creating /etc/default/virtualbox, see
          <xref linkend="linux_install_opts"/>. Mode 0600 is preferred.

          <emphasis role="strong"> Monitor system activity.</emphasis>
          System security builds on three pillars: good security
          protocols, proper system configuration and system monitoring.
          Auditing and reviewing audit records address the third
          requirement. Each component within a system has some degree of
          monitoring capability. Follow audit advice in this document
          and regularly monitor audit records.

      <title>Installation Overview</title>

      <para>
        The &product-name; base package should be downloaded only from a
        trusted source, for instance the official website
        <ulink url="http://www.virtualbox.org">http://www.virtualbox.org</ulink>.
        The integrity of the package should be verified with the
        provided SHA256 checksum which can be found on the official
        website.
      </para>

      <para>
        General &product-name; installation instructions for the
        supported hosts can be found in <xref linkend="installation"/>.
      </para>

      <para>
        On Windows hosts, the installer can be used to disable USB
        support, support for bridged networking, support for host-only
        networking and the Python language binding. See
        <xref linkend="installation_windows"/>. All these features are
        enabled by default but disabling some of them could be
        appropriate if the corresponding functionality is not required
        by any virtual machine. The Python language bindings are only
        required if the &product-name; API is to be used by external
        Python applications. In particular USB support and support for
        the two networking modes require the installation of Windows
        kernel drivers on the host. Therefore disabling those selected
        features can not only be used to restrict the user to certain
        functionality but also to minimize the surface provided to a
        potential attacker.
      </para>

      <para>
        The general case is to install the complete &product-name;
        package. The installation must be done with system privileges.
        All &product-name; binaries should be executed as a regular user
        and never as a privileged user.
      </para>

      <para>
        The &product-name; Extension Pack provides additional features
        and must be downloaded and installed separately, see
        <xref linkend="intro-installing"/>. As for the base package, the
        SHA256 checksum of the extension pack should be verified. As the
        installation requires system privileges, &product-name; will ask
        for the system password during the installation of the extension
        pack.
      </para>

    <sect2 id="security-secure-install-postinstall">

      <title>Post Installation Configuration</title>

      <para>
        Normally there is no post installation configuration of
        &product-name; components required. However, on Oracle Solaris
        and Linux hosts it is necessary to configure the proper
        permissions for users executing VMs and who should be able to
        access certain host resources. For instance, Linux users must be
        member of the <emphasis>vboxusers</emphasis> group to be able to
        pass USB devices to a guest. If a serial host interface should
        be accessed from a VM, the proper permissions must be granted to
        the user to be able to access that device. The same applies to
        other resources like raw partitions, DVD/CD drives, and sound
        devices.

      <title>The Security Model</title>

      <para>
        One property of virtual machine monitors (VMMs) like
        &product-name; is to encapsulate a guest by executing it in a
        protected environment, a virtual machine, running as a user
        process on the host operating system. The guest cannot
        communicate directly with the hardware or other computers but
        only through the VMM. The VMM provides emulated physical
        resources and devices to the guest which are accessed by the
        guest operating system to perform the required tasks. The VM
        settings control the resources provided to the guest, for
        example the amount of guest memory or the number of guest
        processors and the enabled features for that guest. For example
        remote control, certain screen settings and others. See
        <xref linkend="generalsettings"/>.

      <title>Secure Configuration of Virtual Machines</title>

      <para>
        Several aspects of a virtual machine configuration are subject
        to security considerations.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="security-networking">

        <title>Networking</title>

        <para>
          The default networking mode for VMs is NAT which means that
          the VM acts like a computer behind a router, see
          <xref linkend="network_nat"/>. The guest is part of a private
          subnet belonging to this VM and the guest IP is not visible
          from the outside. This networking mode works without any
          additional setup and is sufficient for many purposes.
        </para>

        <para>
          If bridged networking is used, the VM acts like a computer
          inside the same network as the host, see
          <xref linkend="network_bridged"/>. In this case, the guest has
          the same network access as the host and a firewall might be
          necessary to protect other computers on the subnet from a
          potential malicious guest as well as to protect the guest from
          a direct access from other computers. In some cases it is
          worth considering using a forwarding rule for a specific port
          in NAT mode instead of using bridged networking.
        </para>

        <para>
          Some setups do not require a VM to be connected to the public
          network at all. Internal networking, see
          <xref linkend="network_internal"/>, or host-only networking,
          see <xref linkend="network_hostonly"/>, are often sufficient
          to connect VMs among each other or to connect VMs only with
          the host but not with the public network.
        </para>

      <sect3 id="security-vrdp-auth">

        <title>VRDP Remote Desktop Authentication</title>

        <para>
          When using the &product-name; Extension Pack provided by
          Oracle for VRDP remote desktop support, you can optionally use
          various methods to configure RDP authentication. The "null"
          method is very insecure and should be avoided in a public
          network. See <xref linkend="vbox-auth" />.
        </para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="security_clipboard">

        <title>Clipboard</title>

        <para>
          The shared clipboard enables users to share data between the
          host and the guest. Enabling the clipboard in Bidirectional
          mode enables the guest to read and write the host clipboard.
          The Host to Guest mode and the Guest to Host mode limit the
          access to one direction. If the guest is able to access the
          host clipboard it can also potentially access sensitive data
          from the host which is shared over the clipboard.
        </para>

        <para>
          If the guest is able to read from and/or write to the host
          clipboard then a remote user connecting to the guest over the
          network will also gain this ability, which may not be
          desirable. As a consequence, the shared clipboard is disabled
          for new machines.
        </para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="security-shared-folders">

        <title>Shared Folders</title>

        <para>
          If any host folder is shared with the guest then a remote user
          connected to the guest over the network can access these files
          too as the folder sharing mechanism cannot be selectively
          disabled for remote users.

          Enabling CD/DVD passthrough enables the guest to perform
          advanced operations on the CD/DVD drive, see
          <xref linkend="storage-cds"/>. This could induce a security
          risk as a guest could overwrite data on a CD/DVD medium.

          Passing USB devices to the guest provides the guest full
          access to these devices, see <xref linkend="settings-usb"/>.
          For instance, in addition to reading and writing the content
          of the partitions of an external USB disk the guest will be
          also able to read and write the partition table and hardware
          data of that disk.

            When teleporting a machine, the data stream through which
            the machine's memory contents are transferred from one host
            to another is not encrypted. A third party with access to
            the network through which the data is transferred could
            therefore intercept that data. An SSH tunnel could be used
            to secure the connection between the two hosts. But when
            considering teleporting a VM over an untrusted network the
            first question to answer is how both VMs can securely access
            the same virtual disk image with a reasonable performance.

            When Page Fusion, see <xref linkend="guestadd-pagefusion"/>,
            is enabled, it is possible that a side-channel opens up that
            enables a malicious guest to determine the address space of
            another VM running on the same host layout. For example,
            where DLLs are typically loaded. This information leak in
            itself is harmless, however the malicious guest may use it
            to optimize attack against that VM through unrelated attack
            vectors. It is recommended to only enable Page Fusion if you
