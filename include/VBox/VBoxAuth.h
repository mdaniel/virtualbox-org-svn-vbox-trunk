/** UUID memory representation. Array of 16 bytes.
 *
 * @note VirtualBox uses a consistent binary representation of UUIDs on all platforms. For this reason
 * the integer fields comprising the UUID are stored as little endian values. If you want to pass such
 * UUIDs to code which assumes that the integer fields are big endian (often also called network byte
 * order), you need to adjust the contents of the UUID to e.g. achieve the same string representation.
 *
 * The required changes are:
 *     - reverse the order of byte 0, 1, 2 and 3
 *     - reverse the order of byte 4 and 5
 *     - reverse the order of byte 6 and 7.
 *
 * Using this conversion you will get identical results when converting the binary UUID to the string
 * representation.
