/* GUI and VBox OpenGL code require scaling factor value to be stored in container
 * of type of 'double'. Communication between them is done via Main. In the same time,
 * currently, Main does not like type of 'double' to be used for an interface method parameter.
 * An integer type should be used instead. This value is used in order to specify scaling factor in type
 * of 'integer' units. It is assumed that GUI feeds Main with its internal scaling factor value
 * (which is originally of type of 'double') multiplied by this constant and converted resulting
 * value to type of 'uint32_t'. Then Main provides this data to OpenGL HGCM thread. Finally, VBox OpenGL
 * code divides received scalar by this constant and converts result to type of 'double'.
 * This constant can be increased (multiplied by 10^n) in order to get better precision
 * for scaling factor manipulations. */
