/**
 * General discussion:
 *
 * In COM all errors are stored on a per thread basis. In general this means
 * only _one_ active error is possible per thread. A new error will overwrite
 * the previous one. To prevent this use MultiResult or ErrorInfoKeeper (see
 * below). The implementations in MSCOM/XPCOM differ slightly, but the details
 * are handled by this glue code.
 *
 * We have different classes which are involved in the error management. I try
 * to describe them separately to make clear what they are there for.
 *
 * ErrorInfo:
 *
 *  This class is able to retrieve the per thread error and store it into its
 *  member variables. This class can also handle non-VirtualBox errors (like
 *  standard COM errors).
 *
 * ProgressErrorInfo:
 *
 *  This is just a simple wrapper class to get the ErrorInfo stored within an
 *  IProgress object. That is the error which was stored when the progress
 *  object was in use and not an error produced by IProgress itself.
 *
 * IVirtualBoxErrorInfo:
 *
 *  The VirtualBox interface class for accessing error information from Main
 *  clients. This class is also used for storing the error information in the
 *  thread context.
 *
 * ErrorInfoKeeper:
 *
 *  A helper class which stores the current per thread info internally. After
 *  calling methods which may produce other errors it is possible to restore
 *  the previous error and therefore restore the situation before calling the
 *  other methods.
 *
 * MultiResult:
 *
 *  Creating an instance of MultiResult turns error chain saving on. All errors
 *  which follow will be saved in a chain for later access.
 *
 * COMErrorInfo (Qt/Gui only):
 *
 *  The Qt GUI does some additional work for saving errors. Because we create
 *  wrappers for _every_ COM call, it is possible to automatically save the
 *  error info after the execution. This allow some additional info like saving
 *  the callee. Please note that this error info is saved on the client side
 *  and therefore locally to the object instance. See COMBaseWithEI,
 *  COMErrorInfo and the generated COMWrappers.cpp in the GUI.
 *
 * Errors itself are set in VirtualBoxBase::setErrorInternal. First a
 * IVirtualBoxErrorInfo object is created and the given error is saved within.
 * If MultiResult is active the current per thread error is fetched and
 * attached to the new created IVirtualBoxErrorInfo object. Next this object is
 * set as the new per thread error.
 *
 * Some general hints:
 *
 * - Always use setError, especially when you are working in an asynchronous thread
 *   to indicate an error. Otherwise the error information itself will not make
 *   it into the client.
 *
 */

/**
 *  The ErrorInfo class provides a convenient way to retrieve error
 *  information set by the most recent interface method, that was invoked on
 *  the current thread and returned an unsuccessful result code.
 *
 *  Once the instance of this class is created, the error information for
 *  the current thread is cleared.
 *
 *  There is no sense to use instances of this class after the last
 *  invoked interface method returns a success.
 *
 *  The class usage pattern is as follows:
 *  <code>
 *      IFoo *foo;
 *      ...
 *      HRESULT rc = foo->SomeMethod();
 *      if (FAILED(rc)) {
 *          ErrorInfo info(foo);
 *          if (info.isFullAvailable()) {
 *              printf("error message = %ls\n", info.getText().raw());
 *          }
 *      }
 *  </code>
 *
 *  This class fetches error information using the IErrorInfo interface on
 *  Win32 (MS COM) or the nsIException interface on other platforms (XPCOM),
 *  or the extended IVirtualBoxErrorInfo interface when when it is available
 *  (i.e. a given IErrorInfo or nsIException instance implements it).
 *  Currently, IVirtualBoxErrorInfo is only available for VirtualBox components.
 *
 *  ErrorInfo::isFullAvailable() and ErrorInfo::isBasicAvailable() determine
 *  what level of error information is available. If #isBasicAvailable()
 *  returns true, it means that only IErrorInfo or nsIException is available as
 *  the source of information (depending on the platform), but not
 *  IVirtualBoxErrorInfo. If #isFullAvailable() returns true, it means that all
 *  three interfaces are available. If both methods return false, no error info
 *  is available at all.
 *
 *  Here is a table of correspondence between this class methods and
 *  and IErrorInfo/nsIException/IVirtualBoxErrorInfo attributes/methods:
 *
 *  ErrorInfo       IErrorInfo      nsIException    IVirtualBoxErrorInfo
 *  --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  getResultCode   --              result          resultCode
 *  getIID          GetGUID         --              interfaceID
 *  getComponent    GetSource       --              component
 *  getText         GetDescription  message         text
 *
 *  '--' means that this interface does not provide the corresponding portion
 *  of information, therefore it is useless to query it if only
 *  #isBasicAvailable() returns true. As it can be seen, the amount of
 *  information provided at the basic level, depends on the platform
 *  (MS COM or XPCOM).
