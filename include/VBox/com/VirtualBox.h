/** @file
 * MS COM / XPCOM Abstraction Layer - VirtualBox COM Library definitions.
 *
 * @note This is the main header file that COM/XPCOM clients include; however,
 *       it is only a wrapper around another platform-dependent include file
 *       that contains the real COM/XPCOM interface declarations.  That other
 *       include file is generated automatically at build time from
 *       /src/VBox/Main/idl/VirtualBox.xidl, which contains all the VirtualBox
 *       interfaces; the include file is called VirtualBox.h on Windows hosts
 *       and VirtualBox_XPCOM.h on Linux hosts.  The build process places it in
 *       out/{platform}/bin/sdk/include, from where it gets
 *       included by the rest of the VirtualBox code.
