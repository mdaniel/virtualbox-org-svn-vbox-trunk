/* This should be similar to VMReq, only difference there will be a pool
   of worker threads instead of EMT. The actual implementation should be
   made in IPRT so we can reuse it for other stuff later. The reason why
   it should be put in PDM is because we need to manage it wrt to VM
   state changes (need exception - add a flag for this). */
