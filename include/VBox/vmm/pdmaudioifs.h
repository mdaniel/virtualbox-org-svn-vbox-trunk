/**
 * == Audio architecture overview
 *
 * The audio architecture mainly consists of two PDM interfaces, PDMAUDIOCONNECTOR
 * and PDMIHOSTAUDIO.
 *
 * The PDMAUDIOCONNECTOR interface is responsible of connecting a device emulation, such
 * as SB16, AC'97 and HDA to one or multiple audio backend(s). Its API abstracts audio
 * stream handling and I/O functions, device enumeration and so on.
 *
 * The PDMIHOSTAUDIO interface must be implemented by all audio backends to provide an
 * abstract and common way of accessing needed functions, such as transferring output audio
 * data for playing audio or recording input from the host.
 *
 * A device emulation can have one or more LUNs attached to it, whereas these LUNs in turn
 * then all have their own PDMIAUDIOCONNECTOR, making it possible to connect multiple backends
 * to a certain device emulation stream (multiplexing).
 *
 * An audio backend's job is to record and/or play audio data (depending on its capabilities).
 * It highly depends on the host it's running on and needs very specific (host-OS-dependent) code.
 * The backend itself only has very limited ways of accessing and/or communicating with the
 * PDMIAUDIOCONNECTOR interface via callbacks, but never directly with the device emulation or
 * other parts of the audio sub system.
 *
 *
 * == Mixing
 *
 * The AUDIOMIXER API is optionally available to create and manage virtual audio mixers.
 * Such an audio mixer in turn then can be used by the device emulation code to manage all
 * the multiplexing to/from the connected LUN audio streams.
 *
 * Currently only input and output stream are supported. Duplex stream are not supported yet.
 *
 * This also is handy if certain LUN audio streams should be added or removed during runtime.
 *
 * To create a group of either input or output streams the AUDMIXSINK API can be used.
 *
 * For example: The device emulation has one hardware output stream (HW0), and that output
 *              stream shall be available to all connected LUN backends. For that to happen,
 *              an AUDMIXSINK sink has to be created and attached to the device's AUDIOMIXER object.
 *
 *              As every LUN has its own AUDMIXSTREAM object, adding all those objects to the
 *              just created audio mixer sink will do the job.
 *
 * Note: The AUDIOMIXER API is purely optional and is not used by all currently implemented
 *       device emulations (e.g. SB16).
 *
 *
 * == Data processing
 *
 * Audio input / output data gets handed-off to/from the device emulation in an unmodified
 * - that is, raw - way. The actual audio frame / sample conversion is done via the PDMAUDIOMIXBUF API.
 *
 * This concentrates the audio data processing in one place and makes it easier to test / benchmark
 * such code.
 *
 * A PDMAUDIOFRAME is the internal representation of a single audio frame, which consists of a single left
 * and right audio sample in time. Only mono (1) and stereo (2) channel(s) currently are supported.
 *
 *
 * == Timing
 *
 * Handling audio data in a virtual environment is hard, as the human perception is very sensitive
 * to the slightest cracks and stutters in the audible data. This can happen if the VM's timing is
 * lagging behind or not within the expected time frame.
 *
 * The two main components which unfortunately contradict each other is a) the audio device emulation
 * and b) the audio backend(s) on the host. Those need to be served in a timely manner to function correctly.
 * To make e.g. the device emulation rely on the pace the host backend(s) set - or vice versa - will not work,
 * as the guest's audio system / drivers then will not be able to compensate this accordingly.
 *
 * So each component, the device emulation, the audio connector(s) and the backend(s) must do its thing
 * *when* it needs to do it, independently of the others. For that we use various (small) ring buffers to
 * (hopefully) serve all components with the amount of data *when* they need it.
 *
 * Additionally, the device emulation can run with a different audio frame size, while the backends(s) may
 * require a different frame size (16 bit stereo -> 8 bit mono, for example).
 *
 * The device emulation can give the audio connector(s) a scheduling hint (optional), e.g. in which interval
 * it expects any data processing.
 *
 * A data transfer for playing audio data from the guest on the host looks like this:
 * (RB = Ring Buffer, MB = Mixing Buffer)
 *
 * (A) Device DMA -> (B) Device RB -> (C) Audio Connector Guest MB -> (D) Audio Connector Host MB -> \
 * (E) Backend RB (optional, up to the backend) > (F) Backend audio framework
 *
 * For capturing audio data the above chain is similar, just in a different direction, of course.
 *
 * The audio connector hereby plays a key role when it comes to (pre-) buffering data to minimize any audio stutters
 * and/or cracks. The following values, which also can be tweaked via CFGM / extra-data are available:
 *
 * - The pre-buffering time (in ms): Audio data which needs to be buffered before any playback (or capturing) can happen.
 * - The actual buffer size (in ms): How big the mixing buffer (for C and D) will be.
 * - The period size (in ms): How big a chunk of audio (often called period or fragment) for F must be to get handled correctly.
 *
 * The above values can be set on a per-driver level, whereas input and output streams for a driver also can be handled
 * set independently. The verbose audio (release) log will tell about the (final) state of each audio stream.
