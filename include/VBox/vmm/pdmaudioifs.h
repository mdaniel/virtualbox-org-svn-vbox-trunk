note bottom of DrvAudioVRDE
    The backend driver is sometimes not configured if the component it represents
    is not configured for the VM.  However, Main will still set up the LUN but
    with just DrvAudio attached to simplify runtime activation of the component.
    In the meanwhile, the DrvAudio instance works as if DrvHostAudioNull were attached.

 * Actors:
 *      - An audio device implementation: "DevAudio"
 *          - Mixer instance (AudioMixer.cpp) with one or more mixer
 *            sinks: "Output Sink",  "Input Sink"
 *          - One DMA engine teamed up with each mixer sink: "Output DMA
 *            Engine", "Input DMA Engine"
 *      - The audio driver "DrvAudio" instances attached to LUN0 and LUN1
 *        respectively: "DrvAudio#0", "DrvAudio#1"
 *      - The Windows host audio driver attached to "DrvAudio0": "DrvHostAudioWas"
 *      - The VRDE/VRDP host audio driver attached to "DrvAudio1": "DrvAudioVRDE"
 *
 * Both "Output Sink" and "Input Sink" talks to all the attached driver chains
 * ("DrvAudio #0" and "DrvAudio #1"), but using different PDMAUDIOSTREAM
 * instances.  There can be an arbritrary number of driver chains attached to an
 * audio device, the mixer sinks will multiplex output to each of them and blend
 * input from all of them, taking care of format and rate conversions.  The
 * mixer and mixer sinks does not fit into the PDM device/driver model, because
 * a driver can only have exactly one or zero other drivers attached, so it is
 * implemented as a separate component that all the audio devices share (see
 * AudioMixer.h, AudioMixer.cpp, AudioMixBuffer.h and AudioMixBuffer.cpp).
 *
 * The driver chains attached to LUN0, LUN1, ... LUNn typically have two
 * drivers attached, first DrvAudio and then a backend driver like
 * DrvHostAudioWasApi, DrvHostAudioPulseAudio, or DrvAudioVRDE.  DrvAudio
 * exposes PDMIAUDIOCONNECTOR upwards towards the device and mixer component,
 * and PDMIHOSTAUDIOPORT downwards towards DrvHostAudioWasApi and the other
 * backends.
 *
 * The backend exposes the PDMIHOSTAUDIO upwards towards DrvAudio. It is
 * possible, though, to only have the DrvAudio instance and not backend, in
 * which case DrvAudio works as if the NULL backend was attached.  Main does
 * such setups when the main component we're interfacing with isn't currently
 * active, as this simplifies runtime activation.
 *
 * The purpose of DrvAudio is to make the work of the backend as simple as
 * possible and try avoid needing to write the same code over and over again for
 * each backend.  It takes care of:
 *      - Stream creation, operation, re-initialization and destruction.
 *      - Pre-buffering.
 *      - Thread pool.
 *
 * The purpose of a host audio driver (aka backend) is to interface with the
 * host audio system (or other audio systems like VRDP and video recording).
 * The backend will optionally provide a list of host audio devices, switch
 * between them, and monitor changes to them.  By default our host backends use
 * the default host device and will trigger stream re-initialization if this
 * changes while we're using it.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_audio_device    Virtual Audio Device
 *
 * The virtual device translates the settings of the emulated device into mixing
 * sinks with sample format, sample rate, volume control, and whatnot.
 *
 * It also implements a DMA engine for transfering samples to (input) or from
 * (output) the guest memory. The starting and stopping of the DMA engines are
 * communicated to the associated mixing sinks and by then onto the
 * PDMAUDIOSTREAM instance for each driver chain.  A RTCIRCBUF is used as an
 * intermediary between the DMA engine and the asynchronous worker thread of the
 * mixing sink.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_audio_mixing    Audio Mixing
 *
 * The audio mixer is a mandatory component in an audio device.  It consists of
 * a mixer and one or more sinks with mixer buffers.  The sinks are typically
 * one per virtual output/input connector, so for instance you could have a
 * device with a "PCM Output" sink and a "PCM Input" sink.
 *
 * The audio mixer takes care of:
 *      - Much of the driver chain (LUN) management work.
 *      - Multiplexing output to each active driver chain.
 *      - Blending input from each active driver chain into a single audio
 *        stream.
 *      - Do format conversion (it uses signed 32-bit PCM internally) between
 *        the audio device and all of the LUNs (no common format needed).
 *      - Do sample rate conversions between the device rate and that of the
 *        individual driver chains.
 *      - Apply the volume settings of the device to the audio stream.
 *      - Provide the asynchronous thread that pushes data from the device's
 *        internal DMA buffer and all the way to the backend for output sinks,
 *        and vice versa for input.
 *
 * The term active LUNs above means that not all LUNs will actually produce
 * (input) or consume (output) audio.  The mixer checks the return of
 * PDMIHOSTAUDIO::pfnStreamGetState each time it's processing samples to see
 * which streams are currently active and which aren't.  Inactive streams are
 * ignored.
 *
 * For more info: @ref pg_audio_mixer, @ref pg_audio_mixing_buffers
 *
 * The AudioMixer API reference can be found here:
 *      - @ref grp_pdm_ifs_audio_mixing
 *      - @ref grp_pdm_ifs_audio_mixing_buffers
 *
 *
 * @section sec_pdm_audio_timing    Timing
 *
 * Handling audio data in a virtual environment is hard, as the human perception
 * is very sensitive to the slightest cracks and stutters in the audible data,
 * and the task of playing back and recording audio is in the real-time domain.
 *
 * The virtual machine is not executed with any real-time guarentees, only best
 * effort, mainly because it is subject to preemptive scheduling on the host
 * side.  The audio processing done on the guest side is typically also subject
 * to preemptive scheduling on the guest side and available CPU processing power
 * there.
 *
 * Thus, the guest may be lagging behind because the host prioritizes other
 * processes/threads over the virtual machine.  This will, if it's too servere,
 * cause the virtual machine to speed up it's time sense while it's trying to
 * catch up.  So, we can easily have a bit of a seesaw execution going on here,
 * where in the playback case, the guest produces data too slowly for while and
 * then switches to producing it too quickly for a while to catch up.
 *
 * Our working principle is that the backends and the guest are producing and
 * consuming samples at the same rate, but we have to deal with the uneven
 * execution.
 *
 * To deal with this we employ (by default) 300ms of backend buffer and
 * pre-buffer 150ms of that for both input and output audio streams.  This means
 * we have about 150ms worth of samples to feed to the host audio device should
 * the virtual machine be starving and lagging behind.  Likewise, we have about
 * 150ms of buffer space will can fill when the VM is in a catch-up mode.  Now,
 * 300ms and 150 ms isn't much for the purpose of glossing over
 * scheduling/timing differences here, but we can't do too much more or the lag
 * will grow rather annoying.  The pre-buffering is implemented by DrvAudio.
 *
 * In addition to the backend buffer that defaults to 300ms, we have the
 * internal DMA buffer of the device and the mixing buffer of the mixing sink.
 * The latter two are typically rather small, sized to fit the anticipated DMA
 * period currently in use by the guest.
