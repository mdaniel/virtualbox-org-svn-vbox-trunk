/**
 * An auto pointer-type class for resources which take a C-style destructor
 * (RTMemFree() or equivalent).
 *
 * The idea of this class is to manage resources which the current code is
 * responsible for freeing.  By wrapping the resource in an RTCAutoRes, you
 * ensure that the resource will be freed when you leave the scope in which
 * the RTCAutoRes is defined, unless you explicitly release the resource.
 *
 * A typical use case is when a function is allocating a number of resources.
 * If any single allocation fails then all other resources must be freed.  If
 * all allocations succeed, then the resources should be returned to the
 * caller.  By placing all allocated resources in RTCAutoRes containers, you
 * ensure that they will be freed on failure, and only have to take care of
 * releasing them when you return them.
 *
 * @param   T           The type of the resource.
 * @param   Destruct    The function to be used to free the resource.
 *                      This parameter must be supplied if there is no
 *                      specialisation of RTAutoDestruct available for @a T.
 * @param   NilRes      The function returning the NIL value for T. Required.
 *                      This parameter must be supplied if there is no
 *                      specialisation of RTAutoResNil available for @a T.
 *
 * @note    The class can not be initialised directly using assignment, due
 *          to the lack of a copy constructor. This is intentional.
