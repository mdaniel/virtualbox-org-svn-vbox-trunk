/** @page   pg_rt_filelock      RT File locking API description
 *
 * File locking general rules:
 *
 * Region to lock or unlock can be located beyond the end of file, this can be used for
 * growing files.
 * Read (or Shared) locks can be acquired held by an unlimited number of processes at the
 * same time, but a Write (or Exclusive) lock can only be acquired by one process, and
 * cannot coexist with a Shared lock. To acquire a Read lock, a process must wait until
 * there are no processes holding any Write locks. To acquire a Write lock, a process must
 * wait until there are no processes holding either kind of lock.
 * By default, RTFileLock and RTFileChangeLock calls returns error immediately if the lock
 * can't be acquired due to conflict with other locks, however they can be called in wait mode.
 *
 * Differences in implementation:
 *
 * Win32, OS/2: Locking is mandatory, since locks are enforced by the operating system.
 * I.e. when file region is locked in Read mode, any write in it will fail; in case of Write
 * lock - region can be read and writed only by lock's owner.
 *
 * Win32: File size change (RTFileSetSize) is not controlled by locking at all (!) in the
 * operation system. Also see comments to RTFileChangeLock API call.
 *
 * Linux/Posix: By default locks in Unixes are advisory. This means that cooperating processes
 * may use locks to coordinate access to a file between themselves, but programs are also free
 * to ignore locks and access the file in any way they choose to.
 *
 * Additional reading:
 *     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_locking

/** @page pg_rt_asyncio RT File async I/O API
 *
 * File operations are usually blocking the calling thread until
 * they completed making it impossible to let the thread do anything
 * else in-between.
 * The RT File async I/O API provides an easy and efficient way to
 * access files asynchronously using the native facilities provided
 * by each operating system.
 *
 * @section sec_rt_asyncio_objects       Objects
 *
 * There are two objects used in this API.
 * The first object is the request. A request contains every information
 * needed two complete the file operation successfully like the start offset
 * and pointer to the source or destination buffer.
 * Requests are created with RTFileAioReqCreate() and destroyed with
 * RTFileAioReqDestroy().
 * Because creating a request may require allocating various operating
 * system dependent resources and may be quite expensive it is possible
 * to use a request more than once to save CPU cycles.
 * A request is constructed with either RTFileAioReqPrepareRead()
 * which will set up a request to read from the given file or
 * RTFileAioReqPrepareWrite() which will write to a given file.
 *
 * The second object is the context. A file is associated with a context
 * and requests for this file may complete only on the context the file
 * was associated with and not on the context given in RTFileAioCtxSubmit()
 * (see below for further information).
 * RTFileAioCtxWait() is used to wait for completion of requests which were
 * associated with the context. While waiting for requests the thread can not
 * respond to global state changes. That's why the API provides a way to let
 * RTFileAioCtxWait() return immediately no matter how many requests
 * have finished through RTFileAioCtxWakeup(). The return code is
 * VERR_INTERRUPTED to let the thread know that he got interrupted.
 *
 * @section sec_rt_asyncio_request_states  Request states
 *
 * Created:
 * After a request was created with RTFileAioReqCreate() it is in the same state
 * like it just completed successfully. RTFileAioReqGetRC() will return VINF_SUCCESS
 * and a transfer size of 0. RTFileAioReqGetUser() will return NULL. The request can be
 * destroyed RTFileAioReqDestroy(). It is also allowed to prepare a the request
 * for a data transfer with the RTFileAioReqPrepare* methods.
 * Calling any other method like RTFileAioCtxSubmit() will return VERR_FILE_AIO_NOT_PREPARED
 * and RTFileAioReqCancel() returns VERR_FILE_AIO_NOT_SUBMITTED.
 *
 * Prepared:
 * A request will enter this state if one of the RTFileAioReqPrepare* methods
 * is called. In this state you can still destroy and retrieve the user data
 * associated with the request but trying to cancel the request or getting
 * the result of the operation will return VERR_FILE_AIO_NOT_SUBMITTED.
 *
 * Submitted:
 * A prepared request can be submitted with RTFileAioCtxSubmit(). If the operation
 * succeeds it is not allowed to touch the request or free any resources until
 * it completed through RTFileAioCtxWait(). The only allowed method is RTFileAioReqCancel()
 * which tries to cancel the request. The request will go into the completed state
 * and RTFileAioReqGetRC() will return VERR_FILE_AIO_CANCELED.
 * If the request completes not matter if successfully or with an error it will
 * switch into the completed state. RTFileReqDestroy() fails if the given request
 * is in this state.
 *
 * Completed:
 * The request will be in this state after it completed and returned through
 * RTFileAioCtxWait(). RTFileAioReqGetRC() returns the final result code
 * and the number of bytes transferred.
 * The request can be used for new data transfers.
 *
 * @section sec_rt_asyncio_threading       Threading
 *
 * The API is a thin wrapper around the specific host OS APIs and therefore
 * relies on the thread safety of the underlying API.
 * The interesting functions with regards to thread safety are RTFileAioCtxSubmit()
 * and RTFileAioCtxWait(). RTFileAioCtxWait() must not be called from different
 * threads at the same time with the same context handle. The same applies to
 * RTFileAioCtxSubmit(). However it is possible to submit new requests from a different
 * thread while waiting for completed requests on another thread with RTFileAioCtxWait().
 *
 * @section sec_rt_asyncio_implementations  Differences in implementation
 *
 * Because the host APIs are quite different on every OS and every API has other limitations
 * there are some things to consider to make the code as portable as possible.
 *
 * The first restriction at the moment is that every buffer has to be aligned to a 512 byte boundary.
 * This limitation comes from the Linux io_* interface. To use the interface the file
 * must be opened with O_DIRECT. This flag disables the kernel cache too which may
 * degrade performance but is unfortunately the only way to make asynchronous
 * I/O work till today (if O_DIRECT is omitted io_submit will revert to sychronous behavior
 * and will return when the requests finished and when they are queued).
 * It is mostly used by DBMS which do theire own caching.
 * Furthermore there is no filesystem independent way to discover the restrictions at least
 * for the 2.4 kernel series. Since 2.6 the 512 byte boundary seems to be used by all
 * file systems. So Linus comment about this flag is comprehensible but Linux
 * lacks an alternative at the moment.
 *
 * The next limitation applies only to Windows. Requests are not associated with the
 * I/O context they are associated with but with the file the request is for.
 * The file needs to be associated with exactly one I/O completion port and requests
 * for this file will only arrive at that context after they completed and not on
 * the context the request was submitted.
 * To associate a file with a specific context RTFileAioCtxAssociateWithFile() is
 * used. It is only implemented on Windows and does nothing on the other platforms.
 * If the file needs to be associated with different context for some reason
 * the file must be closed first. After it was opened again the new context
 * can be associated with the other context.
 * This can't be done by the API because there is no way to retrieve the flags
 * the file was opened with.
