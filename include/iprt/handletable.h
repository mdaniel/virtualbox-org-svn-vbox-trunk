 * Callback for retaining an object during the lookup and free calls.
 *
 * This callback is executed when a handle is being looked up in one
 * way or another from behind the handle table lock. This allows you
 * to increase the reference (or some equivalent thing) during the
 * handle lookup and thereby eliminate any race with anyone trying
 * to free the handle.
 *
 * Note that there is no counterpart to this callback, so if you make
 * use of this you'll have to release the object manually of course.
 *
 * Another use of this callback is to do some extra access checking.
 * Use the return code to indicate whether the lookup should fail
 * or not (no object is returned on faliure, naturally).
 *
 * @returns IPRT status code for the lookup (the caller won't see this).

 * @param   pvObj           The object which has been looked up.
