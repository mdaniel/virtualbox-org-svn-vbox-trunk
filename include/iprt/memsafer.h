 *
 * This API doesn't provide 100% secure storage, it only provider more secure
 * and safer storage.  Thus the API isn't called RTMemSafe because you cannot
 * assume the data is safe against all kinds of extraction methods.
 *
 * The API guarantee that the memory won't be returned to the system containing
 * any of the information you put there.  It will be repeatedly wiped after use.
 *
 * The API tries to isolate your data from other information stored in the
 * process/system.  How well this is done depends on the implementation.  The
 * more complicated implementations will provide protection against heartbleed
 * like bugs where pieces of the heap is copied onto the wire.
 *
 * The more hardened implementations of the API will also do their best to
 * prevent the memory from ending up in process dumps or being readable by
 * debuggers.
 *
 * Finally, two functions are provided for scrambling the sensitive memory while
 * it's not in use.
