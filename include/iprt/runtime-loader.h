/** @defgroup grp_rt_runtime_loader     Runtime Loader Generation
 * @ingroup grp_rt
 *
 * How to use this loader generator
 *
 * This loader generator can be used to generate stub code for loading a shared
 * library and its functions at runtime, or for generating a header file with
 * the declaration of the loader function and optionally declarations for the
 * functions loaded.  It should be included in a header file or a C source
 * file, after defining certain macros which it makes use of.
 *
 * To generate the C source code for function proxy stubs and the library
 * loader function, you should define the following macros in your source file
 * before including this header:
 *
 *  RT_RUNTIME_LOADER_LIB_NAME       - the file name of the library to load
 *  RT_RUNTIME_LOADER_FUNCTION       - the name of the loader function
 *  RT_RUNTIME_LOADER_INSERT_SYMBOLS - a macro containing the names of the
 *                                     functions to be loaded, defined in the
 *                                     following pattern:
 * @code
 * #define RT_RUNTIME_LOADER_INSERT_SYMBOLS \
 *  RT_PROXY_STUB(func_name, ret_type, (long_param_list), (short_param_list)) \
 *  RT_PROXY_STUB(func_name2, ret_type2, (long_param_list2), (short_param_list2)) \
 *  ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * where long_param_list is a parameter list for declaring the function of the
 * form (type1 arg1, type2 arg2, ...) and short_param_list for calling it, of
 * the form (arg1, arg2, ...).
 *
 * To generate the header file, you should define RT_RUNTIME_LOADER_FUNCTION
 * and if you wish to generate declarations for the functions you should
 * additionally define RT_RUNTIME_LOADER_INSERT_SYMBOLS as above and
 * RT_RUNTIME_LOADER_GENERATE_DECLS (without a value) before including this
 * file.

/** @todo this is far too complicated.  A script for generating the files would
 * probably be preferable.
 *
 * bird> An alternative is to generate assembly jump wrappers, this only
 * requires the symbol names and prefix.  I've done this ages ago when we forked
 * the EMX/GCC toolchain on OS/2...  It's a wee bit more annoying in x86 PIC/PIE
 * mode, but nothing that cannot be dealt with.
