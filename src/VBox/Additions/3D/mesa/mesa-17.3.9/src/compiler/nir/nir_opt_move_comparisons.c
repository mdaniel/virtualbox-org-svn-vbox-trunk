/**
 * \file nir_opt_move_comparisons.c
 *
 * This pass moves ALU comparison operations just before their first use.
 *
 * It only moves instructions within a single basic block; cross-block
 * movement is left to global code motion.
 *
 * Many GPUs generate condition codes for comparisons, and use predication
 * for conditional selects and control flow.  In a sequence such as:
 *
 *     vec1 32 ssa_1 = flt a b
 *     <some other operations>
 *     vec1 32 ssa_2 = bcsel ssa_1 c d
 *
 * the backend would likely do the comparison, producing condition codes,
 * then save those to a boolean value.  The intervening operations might
 * trash the condition codes.  Then, in order to do the bcsel, it would
 * need to re-populate the condition code register based on the boolean.
 *
 * By moving the comparison just before the bcsel, the condition codes could
 * be used directly.  This eliminates the need to reload them from the boolean
 * (generally eliminating an instruction).  It may also eliminate the need to
 * create a boolean value altogether (unless it's used elsewhere), which could
 * lower register pressure.
