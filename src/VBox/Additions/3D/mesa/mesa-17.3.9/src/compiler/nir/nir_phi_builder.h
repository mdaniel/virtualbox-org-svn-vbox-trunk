 *     each variable, var, has:
 *         a bitset var.defs of blocks where the variable is defined
 *         a struct nir_phi_builder_value *pb_val
 *
 *     // initialize bitsets
 *     foreach block:
 *         foreach def of variable var:
 *             var.defs[def.block] = true;
 *
 *     // initialize phi builder
 *     pb = nir_phi_builder_create()
 *     foreach var:
 *         var.pb_val = nir_phi_builder_add_value(pb, var.defs)
 *
 *     // Visit each block.  This needs to visit dominators first;
 *     // nir_foreach_block() will be ok.
 *
 *     foreach block:
 *         foreach instruction:
 *             foreach use of variable var:
 *                 replace use with nir_phi_builder_get_block_def(var.pb_val)
 *             foreach def of variable var:
 *                 create ssa def, register with
 *     nir_phi_builder_set_block_def(var.pb_val)
