/**

 *
 * Helper library for carving out smaller allocations (called "(slab) entries")
 * from larger buffers (called "slabs").
 *
 * The library supports maintaining separate heaps (e.g. VRAM vs. GTT). The
 * meaning of each heap is treated as opaque by this library.
 *
 * The library allows delaying the re-use of an entry, i.e. an entry may be
 * freed by calling \ref pb_slab_free even while the corresponding buffer
 * region is still in use by the GPU. A callback function is called to
 * determine when it is safe to allocate the entry again; the user of this
 * library is expected to maintain the required fences or similar.
