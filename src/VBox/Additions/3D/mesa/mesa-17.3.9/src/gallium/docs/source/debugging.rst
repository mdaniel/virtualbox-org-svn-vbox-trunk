Debugging
=========

Debugging utilities in gallium.

Debug Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All drivers respond to a set of common debug environment variables, as well as
some driver-specific variables. Set them as normal environment variables for
the platform or operating system you are running. For example, for Linux this
can be done by typing "export var=value" into a console and then running the
program from that console.

Common
""""""

.. envvar:: GALLIUM_PRINT_OPTIONS <bool> (false)

This option controls if the debug variables should be printed to stderr. This
is probably the most useful variable, since it allows you to find which
variables a driver uses.

.. envvar:: GALLIUM_RBUG <bool> (false)

Controls if the :ref:`rbug` should be used.

.. envvar:: GALLIUM_TRACE <string> ("")

If set, this variable will cause the :ref:`trace` output to be written to the
specified file. Paths may be relative or absolute; relative paths are relative
to the working directory.  For example, setting it to "trace.xml" will cause
the trace to be written to a file of the same name in the working directory.

.. envvar:: GALLIUM_DUMP_CPU <bool> (false)

Dump information about the current CPU that the driver is running on.

.. envvar:: TGSI_PRINT_SANITY <bool> (false)

Gallium has a built-in shader sanity checker.  This option controls whether
the shader sanity checker prints its warnings and errors to stderr.

.. envvar:: DRAW_USE_LLVM <bool> (false)

Whether the :ref:`Draw` module will attempt to use LLVM for vertex and geometry shaders.


State tracker-specific
""""""""""""""""""""""

.. envvar:: ST_DEBUG <flags> (0x0)

Debug :ref:`flags` for the GL state tracker.


Driver-specific
"""""""""""""""

.. envvar:: I915_DEBUG <flags> (0x0)

Debug :ref:`flags` for the i915 driver.

.. envvar:: I915_NO_HW <bool> (false)

Stop the i915 driver from submitting commands to the hardware.

.. envvar:: I915_DUMP_CMD <bool> (false)

Dump all commands going to the hardware.

.. envvar:: LP_DEBUG <flags> (0x0)

Debug :ref:`flags` for the llvmpipe driver.

.. envvar:: LP_NUM_THREADS <int> (number of CPUs)

Number of threads that the llvmpipe driver should use.

.. envvar:: FD_MESA_DEBUG <flags> (0x0)

Debug :ref:`flags` for the freedreno driver.


.. _flags:

Flags
"""""

The variables of type "flags" all take a string with comma-separated flags to
enable different debugging for different parts of the drivers or state
tracker. If set to "help", the driver will print a list of flags which the
variable accepts. Order does not matter.


.. _rbug:

Remote Debugger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The remote debugger, commonly known as rbug, allows for runtime inspections of
:ref:`Context`, :ref:`Screen`, :ref:`Resource` and :ref:`Shader` objects; and
pausing and stepping of :ref:`Draw` calls. Is used with rbug-gui which is
hosted outside of the main mesa repository. rbug is can be used over a network
connection, so the debugger does not need to be on the same machine.
