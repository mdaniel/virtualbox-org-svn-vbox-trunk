                              RBUG PIPE DRIVER


= About =

This directory contains a Gallium3D remote debugger pipe driver.
It provides remote debugging functionality.


= Usage =

Do

   GALLIUM_RBUG=true progs/trivial/tri

which should open gallium remote debugging session. While the program is running
you can launch the small remote debugging application from progs/rbug. More
information is in that directory. Also for a gui see:

   http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/rbug-gui


= Integrating =

You can integrate the rbug pipe driver either inside the state tracker or the 
target. The procedure on both cases is the same. Let's assume you have a 
pipe_screen obtained by the usual means (variable and function names are just
for illustration purposes):

  real_screen = real_screen_create(...);

The rbug screen is then created by doing

  rbug_screen = rbug_screen_create(real_screen);

You can then simply use rbug_screen instead of real_screen.

You can create as many contexts you wish from rbug_screen::context_create they
are automatically wrapped by rbug_screen.
