/**

 *
 * After optimization has occurred, rewrites the shader to have uniform reads
 * reading from the c->uniform_contents[] in order, exactly once each.
 *
 * This allows optimization and instruction scheduling to move things around
 * without worrying about how the hardware has the "each uniform read bumps
 * the uniform read address" property.
