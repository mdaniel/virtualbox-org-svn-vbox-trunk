/** @file brw_fs_cmod_propagation.cpp
 *
 * Implements a pass that propagates the conditional modifier from a CMP x 0.0
 * instruction into the instruction that generated x. For instance, in this
 * sequence
 *
 *    add(8)          g70<1>F    g69<8,8,1>F    4096F
 *    cmp.ge.f0(8)    null       g70<8,8,1>F    0F
 *
 * we can do the comparison as part of the ADD instruction directly:
 *
 *    add.ge.f0(8)    g70<1>F    g69<8,8,1>F    4096F
 *
 * If there had been a use of the flag register and another CMP using g70
 *
 *    add.ge.f0(8)    g70<1>F    g69<8,8,1>F    4096F
 *    (+f0) sel(8)    g71<F>     g72<8,8,1>F    g73<8,8,1>F
 *    cmp.ge.f0(8)    null       g70<8,8,1>F    0F
 *
 * we can recognize that the CMP is generating the flag value that already
 * exists and therefore remove the instruction.
