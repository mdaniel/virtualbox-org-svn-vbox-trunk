/**
 * Try to replace IF/MOV+/ELSE/MOV+/ENDIF with SEL.
 *
 * Many GLSL shaders contain the following pattern:
 *
 *    x = condition ? foo : bar
 *
 * or
 *
 *    if (...) a.xyzw = foo.xyzw;
 *    else     a.xyzw = bar.xyzw;
 *
 * The compiler emits an ir_if tree for this, since each subexpression might be
 * a complex tree that could have side-effects or short-circuit logic.
 *
 * However, the common case is to simply select one of two constants or
 * variable values---which is exactly what SEL is for.  In this case, the
 * assembly looks like:
 *
 *    (+f0) IF
 *    MOV dst src0
 *    ...
 *    ELSE
 *    MOV dst src1
 *    ...
 *    ENDIF
 *
 * where each pair of MOVs to a common destination and can be easily translated
 * into
 *
 *    (+f0) SEL dst src0 src1
 *
 * If src0 is an immediate value, we promote it to a temporary GRF.
