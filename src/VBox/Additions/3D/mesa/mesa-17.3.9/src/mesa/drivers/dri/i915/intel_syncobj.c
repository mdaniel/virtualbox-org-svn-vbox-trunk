/**
 * \file
 * \brief Support for GL_ARB_sync and EGL_KHR_fence_sync.
 *
 * GL_ARB_sync is implemented by flushing the current batchbuffer and keeping a
 * reference on it.  We can then check for completion or wait for completion
 * using the normal buffer object mechanisms.  This does mean that if an
 * application is using many sync objects, it will emit small batchbuffers
 * which may end up being a significant overhead.  In other tests of removing
 * gratuitous batchbuffer syncs in Mesa, it hasn't appeared to be a significant
 * performance bottleneck, though.
