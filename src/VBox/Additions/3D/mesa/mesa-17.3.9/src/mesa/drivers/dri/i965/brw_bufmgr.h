    * buffer's lifetime, we can only know where the buffer was on the last

    * our pointers inside the batch will be using the correct base offset.

    * the kernel treats our offset as a request, and if possible will
    * arrange the buffer to placed at that address (trying to balance
    * the cost of buffer migration versus the cost of performing
    * relocations). Furthermore, we can force the kernel to place the buffer,
    * or report a failure if we specified a conflicting offset, at our chosen
    * offset by specifying EXEC_OBJECT_PINNED.
    *
    * Note the GTT may be either per context, or shared globally across the
    * system. On a shared system, our buffers have to contend for address
    * space with both aperture mappings and framebuffers and so are more
    * likely to be moved. On a full ppGTT system, each batch exists in its
    * own GTT, and so each buffer may have their own offset within each
