    * stalling or doing an extra blit (since our blits are extra expensive,

    * don't.
    *
    * To work around apps, we track what range of the BO we might have used on
    * the GPU as vertex data, tranform feedback output, buffer textures, etc.,
    * and just do glBufferSubData() with an unsynchronized map when they're
    * outside of that range.

    * accessing the BO (and we can map it without synchronization).
