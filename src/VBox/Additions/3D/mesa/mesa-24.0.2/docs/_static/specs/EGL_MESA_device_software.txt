Number

    EGL Extension #TODO

Extension Type

    EGL device extension

Dependencies

    Requires EGL_EXT_device_query.

    This extension is written against the EGL 1.5 Specification.

Overview

    This extension defines a software EGL "device". The device is not backed by
    any actual device node and simply renders into client memory.

    By defining this as an extension, EGL_EXT_device_enumeration is able to
    sanely enumerate a software device.

New Behavior

    The device list produced by eglQueryDevicesEXT will include a software
    device. This can be distinguished from other device classes in the usual
    way by calling eglQueryDeviceStringEXT(EGL_EXTENSIONS) and matching this
    extension's string in the result.

Issues
