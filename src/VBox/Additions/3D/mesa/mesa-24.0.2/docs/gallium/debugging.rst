Debug Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All drivers respond to a set of common debug environment variables, as well as
some driver-specific variables. Set them as normal environment variables for
the platform or operating system you are running. For example, for Linux this
can be done by typing "export var=value" into a console and then running the
program from that console.

See :doc:`../envvars` for details.
