Mesa 10.1.3 Release Notes / (May 9, 2014)
=========================================

Mesa 10.1.3 is a bug fix release which fixes bugs found since the 10.1.2
release.

Note: Mesa 10.1.3 is being released sooner than originally scheduled to
make available a fix for a performance rgression that was inadvertently
introduced to Mesa 10.1.2. The performance regression is reported to
make vmware swapbuffers fall back to software.

Mesa 10.1.3 implements the OpenGL 3.3 API, but the version reported by
glGetString(GL_VERSION) or glGetIntegerv(GL_MAJOR_VERSION) /
glGetIntegerv(GL_MINOR_VERSION) depends on the particular driver being
used. Some drivers don't support all the features required in OpenGL
3.3. OpenGL 3.3 is **only** available if requested at context creation
because compatibility contexts are not supported.
