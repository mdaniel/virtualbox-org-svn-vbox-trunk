Mesa 19.2.6 Release Notes / 2019-11-21
======================================

Mesa 19.2.6 is a bug fix release which fixes bugs found since the 19.2.5
release.

Mesa 19.2.6 implements the OpenGL 4.5 API, but the version reported by
glGetString(GL_VERSION) or glGetIntegerv(GL_MAJOR_VERSION) /
glGetIntegerv(GL_MINOR_VERSION) depends on the particular driver being
used. Some drivers don't support all the features required in OpenGL
4.5. OpenGL 4.5 is **only** available if requested at context creation.
Compatibility contexts may report a lower version depending on each
driver.

Mesa 19.2.6 implements the Vulkan 1.1 API, but the version reported by
the apiVersion property of the VkPhysicalDeviceProperties struct depends
on the particular driver being used.
