Mesa 7.1 Release Notes / August 26, 2008
========================================

Mesa 7.1 is a new development release. There have been many internal
code changes since Mesa 7.0.x. It should be relatively stable, but those
who are especially concerned about stability should wait for Mesa 7.2 or
use Mesa 7.0.4 (the previous stable release).

Note that this version of Mesa does not use the GEM memory manager. The
master branch of git uses GEM.

DRM version 2.3.1 should be used with Mesa 7.1

New features
------------

-  autoconf-based configuration (and clean-up of Makefiles)
-  Assorted DRI driver enhancements
-  Reduced dependencies between X server and Mesa
-  GL_EXT_texture_from_pixmap extension for Xlib driver
-  Support for the GL shading language with i965 driver (implemented by
   Intel)
-  ATI R500 series support (Radeon X1300â€“X1950) in r300 DRI driver

Bug fixes
---------

-  Numerous GLSL fixes
-  Fixed some error code/detection bugs in the GLSL-related API
   functions
-  Lots of DRI driver fixes.

To Do (someday) items
---------------------

-  Remove the MEMCPY() and \_mesa_memcpy() wrappers and just use
   memcpy(). Probably do the same for malloc, calloc, etc. The wrappers
   were useful in the past for memory debugging but now we have
   valgrind. Not worried about SunOS 4 support anymore either...
-  Switch to freeglut
-  Fix linux-glide target/driver.
-  Improved lambda and derivative calculation for frag progs.
