Mesa 9.1 Release Notes / February 22, 2013
==========================================

Mesa 9.1 is a new development release. People who are concerned with
stability and reliability should stick with a previous release or wait
for Mesa 9.1.1.

Mesa 9.1 implements the OpenGL 3.1 API, but the version reported by
glGetString(GL_VERSION) or glGetIntegerv(GL_MAJOR_VERSION) /
glGetIntegerv(GL_MINOR_VERSION) depends on the particular driver being
used. Some drivers don't support all the features required in OpenGL
3.1. OpenGL 3.1 is **only** available if requested at context creation
because GL_ARB_compatibility is not supported.
