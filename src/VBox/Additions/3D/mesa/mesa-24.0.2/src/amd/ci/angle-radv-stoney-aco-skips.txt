# ANGLE throws this warning
# "Unimplemented: CopyImageSubData(../../src/libANGLE/renderer/vulkan/vk_helpers.cpp:6562"
# which is "// No support for emulated compressed formats."
#
# ANGLE doesn't plan on implementing it, given that Android insists on VK having ASTC support
# anyway, so ANGLE-on-RADV is going to need either support inside radv (unlikely) or a compat
# layer.
