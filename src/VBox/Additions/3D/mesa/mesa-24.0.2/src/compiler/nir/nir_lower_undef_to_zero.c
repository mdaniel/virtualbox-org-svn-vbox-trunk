 * Flushes undefined SSA values to a zero vector fo the appropriate component
 * count, to avoid undefined behaviour in the resulting shader. Not required
 * for conformance as use of uninitialized variables is explicitly left
 * undefined by the spec.  Works around buggy apps, however.
 *
 * Call immediately after nir_opt_undef. If called before, larger optimization
 * opportunities from the former pass will be missed. If called outside of an
 * optimization loop, constant propagation and algebraic optimizations won't be
 * able to kick in to reduce stuff consuming the zero.
