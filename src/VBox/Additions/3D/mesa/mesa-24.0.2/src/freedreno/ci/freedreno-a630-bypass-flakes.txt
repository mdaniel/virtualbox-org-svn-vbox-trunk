# Note: flakes lists for CI are just a list of lines that, when
# non-zero-length and not starting with '#', will regex match to
# delete lines from the test list.  Be careful.

# At least some of the separate_channels tests fail on sysmem due to an
# interaction of use of a UBWC buffer as both a render target and a
# texture.  Stores are done through both paths in separate channels,
# and the UBWC updates don't get synced.  The current a650 blob also
# fails these tests and qcom apparently noted the failure at one point
