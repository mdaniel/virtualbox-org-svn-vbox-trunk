    * Notes on address space allocation:
    *
    * In both the import (GEM_INFO) and new (GEM_NEW) path we allocate
    * the iova.  Since the iova (vma on kernel side) is local to the
    * address space, and that is 1:1 with drm fd (which is 1:1 with
    * virtio_device and therefore address_space) which is not shared
    * with anything outside of the driver, and because of the handle
    * de-duplication, we can safely assume that an iova has not yet
    * been set on imported buffers.
    *
    * The other complication with userspace allocated iova is that
    * the kernel holds on to a reference to the bo (and the GPU is
    * still using it's iova) until the submit retires.  So a per-pipe
    * retire_queue is used to hold an extra reference to the submit
    * (and indirectly all the bo's referenced) until the out-fence is
    * signaled.
