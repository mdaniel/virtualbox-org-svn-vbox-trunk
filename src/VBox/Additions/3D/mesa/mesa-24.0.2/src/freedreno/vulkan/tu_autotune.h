/**
 * "autotune" our decisions about bypass vs GMEM rendering, based on historical
 * data about a given render target.
 *
 * In deciding which path to take there are tradeoffs, including some that
 * are not reasonably estimateable without having some additional information:
 *
 *  (1) If you know you are touching every pixel (ie. there is a clear),
 *      then the GMEM path will at least not cost more memory bandwidth than
 *      sysmem[1]
 *
 *  (2) If there is no clear, GMEM could potentially cost *more* bandwidth
 *      if there is sysmem->GMEM restore pass.
 *
 *  (3) If you see a high draw count, that is an indication that there will be
 *      enough pixels accessed multiple times to benefit from the reduced
 *      memory bandwidth that GMEM brings
 *
 *  (4) But high draw count where there is not much overdraw can actually be
 *      faster in bypass mode if it is pushing a lot of state change, due to
 *      not having to go thru the state changes per-tile[1]
 *
 * The approach taken is to measure the samples-passed for the batch to estimate
 * the amount of overdraw to detect cases where the number of pixels touched is
 * low.
 *
 * [1] ignoring early-tile-exit optimizations, but any draw that touches all/
 *     most of the tiles late in the tile-pass can defeat that
