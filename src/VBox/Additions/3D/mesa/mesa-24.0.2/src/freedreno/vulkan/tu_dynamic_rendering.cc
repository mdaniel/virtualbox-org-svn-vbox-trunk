/* When using dynamic rendering with the suspend/resume functionality, we
 * sometimes need to merge together multiple suspended render passes
 * dynamically at submit time. This involves combining all the saved-up IBs,
 * emitting the rendering commands usually emitted by
 * CmdEndRenderPass()/CmdEndRendering(), and inserting them in between the
 * user command buffers. This gets tricky, because the same command buffer can
 * be submitted multiple times, each time with a different other set of
 * command buffers, and with VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT, this can
 * happen before the previous submission of the same command buffer has
 * finished. At some point we have to free these commands and the BOs they are
 * contained in, and we can't do that when resubmitting the last command
 * buffer in the sequence because it may still be in use. This means we have
 * to make the commands owned by the device and roll our own memory tracking.
