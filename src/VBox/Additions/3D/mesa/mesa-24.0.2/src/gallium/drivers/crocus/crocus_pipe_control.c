/**
 * @file crocus_pipe_control.c
 *
 * PIPE_CONTROL is the main flushing and synchronization primitive on Intel
 * GPUs.  It can invalidate caches, stall until rendering reaches various
 * stages of completion, write to memory, and other things.  In a way, it's
 * a swiss army knife command - it has all kinds of capabilities, but some
 * significant limitations as well.
 *
 * Unfortunately, it's notoriously complicated and difficult to use.  Many
 * sub-commands can't be used together.  Some are meant to be used at the
 * top of the pipeline (invalidating caches before drawing), while some are
 * meant to be used at the end (stalling or flushing after drawing).
 *
 * Also, there's a list of restrictions a mile long, which vary by generation.
 * Do this before doing that, or suffer the consequences (usually a GPU hang).
 *
 * This file contains helpers for emitting them safely.  You can simply call
 * crocus_emit_pipe_control_flush() with the desired operations (as logical
 * PIPE_CONTROL_* bits), and it will take care of splitting it into multiple
 * PIPE_CONTROL commands as necessary.  The per-generation workarounds are
 * applied in crocus_emit_raw_pipe_control() in crocus_state.c.

 * "PIPE_CONTROL" of the Sandy Bridge PRM volume 2 part 1:
 *
 * [DevSNB-C+{W/A}] Before any depth stall flush (including those
 * produced by non-pipelined state commands), software needs to first
 * send a PIPE_CONTROL with no bits set except Post-Sync Operation !=
 * 0.
 *
 * [Dev-SNB{W/A}]: Before a PIPE_CONTROL with Write Cache Flush Enable
 * =1, a PIPE_CONTROL with any non-zero post-sync-op is required.
 *
 * And the workaround for these two requires this workaround first:
 *
 * [Dev-SNB{W/A}]: Pipe-control with CS-stall bit set must be sent
 * BEFORE the pipe-control with a post-sync op and no write-cache
 * flushes.
 *
 * And this last workaround is tricky because of the requirements on
 * that bit.  From section 1.4.7.2.3 "Stall" of the Sandy Bridge PRM
 * volume 2 part 1:
 *
 *     "1 of the following must also be set:
 *      - Render Target Cache Flush Enable ([12] of DW1)
 *      - Depth Cache Flush Enable ([0] of DW1)
 *      - Stall at Pixel Scoreboard ([1] of DW1)
 *      - Depth Stall ([13] of DW1)
 *      - Post-Sync Operation ([13] of DW1)
 *      - Notify Enable ([8] of DW1)"
 *
 * The cache flushes require the workaround flush that triggered this
 * one, so we can't use it.  Depth stall would trigger the same.
 * Post-sync nonzero is what triggered this second workaround, so we
 * can't use that one either.  Notify enable is IRQs, which aren't
 * really our business.  That leaves only stall at scoreboard.
