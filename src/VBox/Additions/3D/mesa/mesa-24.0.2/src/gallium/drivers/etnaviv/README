Notes for the etnaviv gallium driver
------------------------------------

There are two ways how this driver might get used:

- application opens kms device (kmscube, weston, ..)
- X via xf86-video-armada

For the kms device case we provide a renderonly based driver like
imx where all the magic for buffer import and export between kms
and renderonly GPU is handled automaticly.

For X/xf86-video-armada we need to provide etnaviv_dri.so.
