/**
 * @file iris_binder.c
 *
 * Shader programs refer to most resources via integer handles.  These are
 * indexes (BTIs) into a "Binding Table", which is simply a list of pointers
 * to SURFACE_STATE entries.  Each shader stage has its own binding table,
 * set by the 3DSTATE_BINDING_TABLE_POINTERS_* commands.  We stream out
 * binding tables dynamically, storing them in special BOs we call "binders."
 *
 * Unfortunately, the hardware designers made 3DSTATE_BINDING_TABLE_POINTERS
 * only accept a 16-bit pointer.  This means that all binding tables have to
 * live within the 64kB range starting at Surface State Base Address.  (The
 * actual SURFACE_STATE entries can live anywhere in the 4GB zone, as the
 * binding table entries are full 32-bit pointers.)
 *
 * To handle this, we split a 4GB region of VMA into two memory zones.
 * IRIS_MEMZONE_BINDER is a 1GB region at the bottom able to hold a few
 * binder BOs.  IRIS_MEMZONE_SURFACE contains the rest of the 4GB, and is
 * always at a higher address than the binders.  This allows us to program
 * Surface State Base Address to the binder BO's address, and offset the
 * values in the binding table to account for the base not starting at the
 * beginning of the 4GB region.
 *
 * This does mean that we have to emit STATE_BASE_ADDRESS and stall when
 * we run out of space in the binder, which hopefully won't happen too often.
