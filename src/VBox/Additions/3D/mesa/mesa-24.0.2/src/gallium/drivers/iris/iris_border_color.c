/**
 * @file iris_border_color.c
 *
 * Each SAMPLER_STATE points to a SAMPLER_BORDER_COLOR_STATE entry,
 * describing the color to return when sampling outside the texture
 * when using CLAMP_TO_BORDER wrap modes.
 *
 * These must be stored relative to Dynamic State Base Address.
 * Unfortunately, the hardware designers only gave us a 24-bit pointer
 * rather than an actual graphics address, so it must be stored in the
 * bottom 16MB of that memory zone.  This means we can't simply use
 * u_upload_mgr like we do for most state.
 *
 * To work around this, we maintain a single "border color pool" BO
 * which we pin at the base of IRIS_MEMZONE_DYNAMIC.  Since most border
 * colors are the same (typically black or white), we maintain a hash
 * table of known colors, and reuse the same entries.  This avoids
 * wasting a lot of space in the pool.
 *
 * If it ever does fill up, we simply return the black border. We
 * can't simply flush since the BO is shared by every context. If we
 * ever need we may choose to have multiple BOs, refcount them and
 * then recycle when unused.
