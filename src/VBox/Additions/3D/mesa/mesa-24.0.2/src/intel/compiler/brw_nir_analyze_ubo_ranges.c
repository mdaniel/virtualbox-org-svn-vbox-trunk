 *
 * This pass decides which portions of UBOs to upload as push constants,
 * so shaders can access them as part of the thread payload, rather than
 * having to issue expensive memory reads to pull the data.
 *
 * The 3DSTATE_CONSTANT_* mechanism can push data from up to 4 different
 * buffers, in GRF (256-bit/32-byte) units.
 *
 * To do this, we examine NIR load_ubo intrinsics, recording the number of
 * loads at each offset.  We track offsets at a 32-byte granularity, so even
 * fields with a bit of padding between them tend to fall into contiguous
 * ranges.  We build a list of these ranges, tracking their "cost" (number
 * of registers required) and "benefit" (number of pull loads eliminated
 * by pushing the range).  We then sort the list to obtain the four best
 * ranges (most benefit for the least cost).
