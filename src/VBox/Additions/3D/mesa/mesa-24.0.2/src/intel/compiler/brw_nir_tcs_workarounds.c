/**
 * Implements the WaPreventHSTessLevelsInterference workaround (for Gfx7-8).
 *
 * From the Broadwell PRM, Volume 7 (3D-Media-GPGPU), Page 494 (below the
 * definition of the patch header layouts):
 *
 *    "HW Bug: The Tessellation stage will incorrectly add domain points
 *     along patch edges under the following conditions, which may result
 *     in conformance failures and/or cracking artifacts:
 *
 *       * QUAD domain
 *       * INTEGER partitioning
 *       * All three TessFactors in a given U or V direction (e.g., V
 *         direction: UEQ0, InsideV, UEQ1) are all exactly 1.0
 *       * All three TessFactors in the other direction are > 1.0 and all
 *         round up to the same integer value (e.g, U direction:
 *         VEQ0 = 3.1, InsideU = 3.7, VEQ1 = 3.4)
 *
 *     The suggested workaround (to be implemented as part of the postamble
 *     to the HS shader in the HS kernel) is:
 *
 *     if (
 *        (TF[UEQ0] > 1.0) ||
 *        (TF[VEQ0] > 1.0) ||
 *        (TF[UEQ1] > 1.0) ||
 *        (TF[VEQ1] > 1.0) ||
 *        (TF[INSIDE_U] > 1.0) ||
 *        (TF[INSIDE_V] > 1.0) )
 *     {
 *        TF[INSIDE_U] = (TF[INSIDE_U] == 1.0) ? 2.0 : TF[INSIDE_U];
 *        TF[INSIDE_V] = (TF[INSIDE_V] == 1.0) ? 2.0 : TF[INSIDE_V];
 *     }"
 *
 * There's a subtlety here.  Intel internal HSD-ES bug 1208668495 notes
 * that the above workaround fails to fix certain GL/ES CTS tests which
 * have inside tessellation factors of -1.0.  This can be explained by
 * a quote from the ARB_tessellation_shader specification:
 *
 *    "If "equal_spacing" is used, the floating-point tessellation level is
 *     first clamped to the range [1,<max>], where <max> is implementation-
 *     dependent maximum tessellation level (MAX_TESS_GEN_LEVEL)."
 *
 * In other words, the actual inner tessellation factor used is
 * clamp(TF[INSIDE_*], 1.0, 64.0).  So we want to compare the clamped
 * value against 1.0.  To accomplish this, we change the comparison from
 * (TF[INSIDE_*] == 1.0) to (TF[INSIDE_*] <= 1.0).
