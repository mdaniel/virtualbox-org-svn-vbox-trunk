   /* anv Virtual Memory Layout
    * =========================
    *
    * When the anv driver is determining the virtual graphics addresses of
    * memory objects itself using the softpin mechanism, the following memory
    * ranges will be used.
    *
    * Three special considerations to notice:
    *
    * (1) the dynamic state pool is located within the same 4 GiB as the low
    * heap. This is to work around a VF cache issue described in a comment in
    * anv_physical_device_init_heaps.
    *
    * (2) the binding table pool is located at lower addresses than the BT
    * (binding table) surface state pool, within a 4 GiB range which also
    * contains the bindless surface state pool. This allows surface state base
    * addresses to cover both binding tables (16 bit offsets), the internal
    * surface states (32 bit offsets) and the bindless surface states.
    *
    * (3) the last 4 GiB of the address space is withheld from the high heap.
    * Various hardware units will read past the end of an object for various
    * reasons. This healthy margin prevents reads from wrapping around 48-bit
    * addresses.

    * of device->gtt_size. We use 47:44 for gen9+, the values we set here

    *
    * If we ever gain the capability to use more than 48 bits of address space
    * we'll have to adjust where we put the TR-TT space (and how we set
    * GFX_TRTT_VA_RANGE).
    *
    * We have to leave the last 4GiB out of the high vma range, so that no
    * state base address + size can overflow 48 bits. For more information see
    * the comment about Wa32bitGeneralStateOffset in anv_allocator.c
    *
    * Despite the comment above, before we had TR-TT we were not only avoiding
    * the last 4GiB of the 48bit address space, but also avoiding the last
    * 4GiB from gtt_size, so let's be on the safe side and do the 4GiB
    * avoiding for both the TR-TT space top and the gtt top.
