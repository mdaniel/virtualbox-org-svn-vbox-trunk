This folder contains a local copy of BLAKE3 cryptographic hash library, version 1.3.3.

Except for changes listed in the "Changes" section, this is a verbatim copy from
https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3, tag 1.3.3.

Files will be periodically synchronized with the upstream, and any local changes should
be clearly documented below.

Changes:
- Rename .asm files to .masm due to a Meson limitation (https://mesonbuild.com/Release-notes-for-0-64-0.html#new-languages-nasm-and-masm)

- Add non-typedef struct name to blake3_hasher.

- Add "static" to blake3_hash4_neon, to comply with -Werror=missing-prototypes.

- Add mesa_blake3_visibility.h and set symbol visibility to hidden for assembly sources.
