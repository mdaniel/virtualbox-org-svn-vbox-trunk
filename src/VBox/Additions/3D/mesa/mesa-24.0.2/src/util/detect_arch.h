 * This header file sets several defines based on the compiler, processor 
 * architecture, and operating system being used. These defines should be used 
 * throughout the code to facilitate porting to new platforms. It is likely that 
 * this file is auto-generated by an autoconf-like tool at some point, as some 
 * things cannot be determined by pre-defined environment alone.
