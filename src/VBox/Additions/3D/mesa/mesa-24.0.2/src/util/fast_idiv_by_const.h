/* Computes "magic info" for performing signed division by a fixed integer D.
 * The type 'sint_t' is assumed to be defined as a signed integer type large
 * enough to hold both the dividend and the divisor.
 * Here >> is arithmetic (signed) shift, and >>> is logical shift.
 *
 * To emit code for n/d, rounding towards zero, use the following sequence:
 *
 *   m = compute_signed_magic_info(D)
 *   emit("result = (m.multiplier * n) >> SINT_BITS");
 *   if d > 0 and m.multiplier < 0: emit("result += n")
 *   if d < 0 and m.multiplier > 0: emit("result -= n")
 *   if m.post_shift > 0: emit("result >>= m.shift")
 *   emit("result += (result < 0)")
 *
 * The shifts by SINT_BITS may be "free" if the high half of the full multiply
 * is put in a separate register.
 *
 * The final add can of course be implemented via the sign bit, e.g.
 *    result += (result >>> (SINT_BITS - 1))
 * or
 *    result -= (result >> (SINT_BITS - 1))

/* Computes "magic info" for performing unsigned division by a fixed positive
 * integer D.  UINT_BITS is the bit size at which the final "magic"
 * calculation will be performed; it is assumed to be large enough to hold
 * both the dividand and the divisor.  num_bits can be set appropriately if n
 * is known to be smaller than calc_bits; if this is not known then UINT_BITS
 * for num_bits.
 *
 * Assume we have a hardware register of width UINT_BITS, a known constant D
 * which is not zero and not a power of 2, and a variable n of width num_bits
 * (which may be up to UINT_BITS). To emit code for n/d, use one of the two
 * following sequences (here >>> refers to a logical bitshift):
 *
 *   m = compute_unsigned_magic_info(D, num_bits)
 *   if m.pre_shift > 0: emit("n >>>= m.pre_shift")
 *   if m.increment: emit("n = saturated_increment(n)")
 *   emit("result = (m.multiplier * n) >>> UINT_BITS")
 *   if m.post_shift > 0: emit("result >>>= m.post_shift")
 *
 * or
 *
 *   m = compute_unsigned_magic_info(D, num_bits)
 *   if m.pre_shift > 0: emit("n >>>= m.pre_shift")
 *   emit("result = m.multiplier * n")
 *   if m.increment: emit("result = result + m.multiplier")
 *   emit("result >>>= UINT_BITS")
 *   if m.post_shift > 0: emit("result >>>= m.post_shift")
 *
 * This second version works even if D is 1.  The shifts by UINT_BITS may be
 * "free" if the high half of the full multiply is put in a separate register.
 *
 * saturated_increment(n) means "increment n unless it would wrap to 0," i.e.
 *   if n == (1 << UINT_BITS)-1: result = n
 *   else: result = n+1
 * A common way to implement this is with the carry bit. For example, on x86:
 *   add 1
 *   sbb 0
 *
 * Some invariants:
 *   1: At least one of pre_shift and increment is zero
 *   2: multiplier is never zero
 *
 * This code incorporates the "round down" optimization per ridiculous_fish.
