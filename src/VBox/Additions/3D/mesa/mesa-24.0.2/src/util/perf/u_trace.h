/* A trace mechanism (very) loosely inspired by the linux kernel tracepoint
 * mechanism, in that it allows for defining driver specific (or common)
 * tracepoints, which generate 'trace_$name()' functions that can be
 * called at various points in commandstream emit.
 *
 * Currently a printf backend is implemented, but the expectation is to
 * also implement a perfetto backend for shipping out traces to a tool like
 * AGI.
 *
 * Notable differences:
 *
 *  - GPU timestamps!  A driver provided callback is used to emit timestamps
 *    to a buffer.  At a later point in time (when stalling to wait for the
 *    GPU is not required), the timestamps are re-united with the trace
 *    payload.  This makes the trace mechanism suitable for profiling.
 *
 *  - Instead of a systemwide trace ringbuffer, buffering of un-retired
 *    tracepoints is split into two stages.  Traces are emitted to a
 *    'u_trace' instance, and at a later time flushed to a 'u_trace_context'
 *    instance.  This avoids the requirement that commandstream containing
 *    tracepoints is emitted in the same order as it is generated.
 *
 *    If the hw has multiple parallel "engines" (for example, 3d/blit/compute)
 *    then a `u_trace_context` per-engine should be used.
 *
 *  - Unlike kernel tracepoints, u_trace tracepoints are defined in py
 *    from which header and src files are generated.  Since we already have
 *    a build dependency on python+mako, this gives more flexibility than
 *    clunky preprocessor macro magic.
