/* mtx_t - Fast, simple mutex
 *
 * While modern pthread mutexes are very fast (implemented using futex), they
 * still incur a call to an external DSO and overhead of the generality and
 * features of pthread mutexes.  Most mutexes in mesa only needs lock/unlock,
 * and the idea here is that we can inline the atomic operation and make the
 * fast case just two intructions.  Mutexes are subtle and finicky to
 * implement, so we carefully copy the implementation from Ulrich Dreppers
 * well-written and well-reviewed paper:
 *
 *   "Futexes Are Tricky"
 *   http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/futex.pdf
 *
 * We implement "mutex3", which gives us a mutex that has no syscalls on
 * uncontended lock or unlock.  Further, the uncontended case boils down to a
 * locked cmpxchg and an untaken branch, the uncontended unlock is just a
 * locked decr and an untaken branch.  We use __builtin_expect() to indicate
 * that contention is unlikely so that gcc will put the contention code out of
 * the main code flow.
 *
 * A fast mutex only supports lock/unlock, can't be recursive or used with
 * condition variables.
