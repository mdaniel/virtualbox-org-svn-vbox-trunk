/** A thread-safe automatically growing sparse array data structure
 *
 * This data structure has the following very nice properties:
 *
 *  1. Accessing an element is basically constant time.  Technically, it's
 *     O(log_b n) where the base b is the node size and n is the maximum
 *     index.  However, node sizes are expected to be fairly large and the
 *     index is a uint64_t so, if your node size is 256, it's O(8).
 *
 *  2. The data stored in the array is never moved in memory.  Instead, the
 *     data structure only ever grows and new nodes are added as-needed.  This
 *     means it's safe to store a pointer to something stored in the sparse
 *     array without worrying about a realloc invalidating it.
 *
 *  3. The data structure is thread-safe.  No guarantees are made about the
 *     data stored in the sparse array but it is safe to call
 *     util_sparse_array_get(arr, idx) from as many threads as you'd like and
 *     we guarantee that two calls to util_sparse_array_get(arr, idx) with the
 *     same array and index will always return the same pointer regardless
 *     contention between threads.
 *
 *  4. The data structure is lock-free.  All manipulations of the tree are
 *     done by a careful use of atomics to maintain thread safety and no locks
 *     are ever taken other than those taken implicitly by calloc().  If no
 *     allocation is required, util_sparse_array_get(arr, idx) does a simple
 *     walk over the tree should be efficient even in the case where many
 *     threads are accessing the sparse array at once.
