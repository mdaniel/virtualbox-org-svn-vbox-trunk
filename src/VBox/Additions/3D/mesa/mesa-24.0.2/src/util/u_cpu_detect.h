    *    effects on such state other than to return a value may lend
    *    themselves to optimizations such as common subexpression elimination.
    *    Declaring such functions with the const attribute allows GCC to avoid
    *    emitting some calls in repeated invocations of the function with the
    *    same argument values."
    *

    * llvmpipe debug flag behind an environment variable and a few unit tests,
    * all of which emulate worse CPUs, this function neither affects nor is
    * affected by any "observable" state.  It has its own internal state for
    * sure, but that state is such that it appears to return exactly the same
    * value with the same internal data every time.
