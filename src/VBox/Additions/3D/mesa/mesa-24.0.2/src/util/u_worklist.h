/** Represents a double-ended queue of unique entries. Each entry must have a
 * unique index in the range [0, num_entries). Internally, entries are tracked
 * as pointers to that index (so you can go from the index pointer back to a
 * containing structure). This requires index pointers to remain valid while
 * they are in the worklist (i.e. no realloc).
 *
 * The worklist data structure guarantees that each entry is in the queue at
 * most once. Pushing an entry onto either end of the queue is a no-op if the
 * entry is already in the queue. Internally, the data structure maintains a
 * bitset of present entries.
