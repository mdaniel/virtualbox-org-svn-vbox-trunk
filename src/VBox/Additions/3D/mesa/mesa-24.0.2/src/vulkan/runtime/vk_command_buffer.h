    * VK_EXT_debug_utils
    *
    * The next two fields represent debug labels storage.
    *
    * VK_EXT_debug_utils spec requires that upon triggering a debug message
    * with a command buffer attached to it, all "active" labels will also be
    * provided to the callback. The spec describes two distinct ways of
    * attaching a debug label to the command buffer: opening a label region
    * and inserting a single label.
    *
    * Label region is active between the corresponding `*BeginDebugUtilsLabel`
    * and `*EndDebugUtilsLabel` calls. The spec doesn't mention any limits on
    * nestedness of label regions. This implementation assumes that there
    * aren't any.
    *
    * The spec, however, doesn't explain the lifetime of a label submitted by
    * an `*InsertDebugUtilsLabel` call. The LunarG whitepaper [1] (pp 12-15)
    * provides a more detailed explanation along with some examples. According
    * to those, such label remains active until the next `*DebugUtilsLabel`
    * call. This means that there can be no more than one such label at a
    * time.
    *
    * ``labels`` contains all active labels at this point in order of
    * submission ``region_begin`` denotes whether the most recent label opens
    * a new region If ``labels`` is empty ``region_begin`` must be true.
    *
    * Anytime we modify labels, we first check for ``region_begin``. If it's
    * false, it means that the most recent label was submitted by
    * `*InsertDebugUtilsLabel` and we need to remove it before doing anything
    * else.
    *
    * See the discussion here:
    * https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/10318#note_1061317
