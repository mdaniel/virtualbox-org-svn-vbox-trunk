 * reference counted so that they can exist in multiple caches (for example,
 * when vkMergePipelineCaches() is called) and so that they can persist after
 * the pipeline cache is destroyed.  Each object also has a pointer to a
 * vk_pipeline_cache_object_ops table which the pipeline cache uses to
 * [de]serialize the object and clean it up when the reference count hits 0.
 *
 * The rest of the details of any given object are entirely up to the driver.
 * The driver may even have multiple types of objects (distinguished by their
 * vk_pipeline_cache_object_ops table) in the cache so long as it guarantees
 * it never has two objects of different types with the same key.
