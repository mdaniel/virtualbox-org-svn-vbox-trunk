    *
    * It's often necessary to store a pointer to the descriptor set layout in
    * the descriptor so that any entrypoint which has access to a descriptor
    * set also has the layout.  While layouts are often passed into various
    * entrypoints, they're notably missing from vkUpdateDescriptorSets().  In
    * order to implement descriptor writes, you either need to stash a pointer
    * to the descriptor set layout in the descriptor set or you need to copy
    * all of the relevant information.  Storing a pointer is a lot cheaper.
    *
    * Because descriptor set layout lifetimes and descriptor set lifetimes are
    * not guaranteed to coincide, we have to reference count if we're going to
    * do this.
