    * the kernel driver for signaling, it is in the pending state and remains
    * there until the work is complete at which point it enters the signaled
    * state.  This pending state is visible across processes for shared
    * vk_sync types.  This is used to by the threaded submit mode to ensure
    * that everything gets submitted to the kernel driver in-order.

    * that value.  Logically, you can think of this as having two timelines,
    * the real timeline and a pending timeline which runs slightly ahead of
