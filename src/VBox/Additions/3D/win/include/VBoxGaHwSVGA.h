 * we send the complete info to the driver.

 * Since both FIFO and SVGA_REG_ are expanded over time, we reserve some space.
 * The Gallium user mode driver can figure out which part of au32Regs and au32Fifo
 * is valid from the raw data.
 *
 * VBOXGAHWINFOSVGA struct goes both to 32 and 64 bit user mode binaries, take care of alignment.
