 * RegCleanup - Remove "InvalidDisplay" and "NewDisplay" keys on NT4,
 *              run via HKLM/.../Windows/CurrentVersion/RunOnce.
 *
 * Delete the "InvalidDisplay" key which causes the display applet to be
 * started on every boot. For some reason this key isn't removed after
 * setting the proper resolution and even not when * doing a driver reinstall.
 * Removing it doesn't seem to do any harm.  The key is inserted by windows on
 * first reboot after installing the VBox video driver using the VirtualBox
 * utility. It's not inserted when using the Display applet for installation.
 * There seems to be a subtle problem with the VirtualBox util.
