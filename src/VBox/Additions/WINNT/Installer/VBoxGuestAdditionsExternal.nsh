; Macro for executing external applications.

; Uses the nsExec plugin in different styles, depending on whether this
; installer runs in silent mode or not. If the external program reports an exit
; code other than 0 the installer will be aborted.
;
; @param   ${cmdline}   Command line (full qualified and quoted).
; @param   ${options}   Either 'non-zero-exitcode=log' or 'non-zero-exitcode=abort'.

;                       case they will trigger an installation abort, while in the
;                       form only a warning in the log file.
