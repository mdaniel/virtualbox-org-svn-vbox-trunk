# XXX:
#
# VBoxGuest-netbsd.c has manually edited copy of the config glue and
# we also provide stub "locators.h" in this directory.  Both should
# really be generated by config(8) from this ioconf file but that runs
# into a couple of problems.
#
# We want to attach wsmouse(4) as a child, but we cannot expect the
# kernel that loads us to have "wsmouse* at wsmousedev?" attachment
# and in fact until recently x86 kernels didn't have it.
#
# But when we specify "wsmouse* at vboxguest?" attachment below
# config(8) thinks that this module defines wsmouse and generates
# CFDRIVER_DECL() for it and also includes it into cfdriver and
# cfattachinit arrays it emits.

ioconf vboxguest

include "conf/files"
