# Usage:
#       led-lights.sh [-a | -r]
#

#
# Test script to twiddle the console LEDs of a VirtualBox VM.
#
# This is not an automated test, just something for humans to look
# at, to convince themselves that the VM console LEDs are working.
# By default it cycles through the LED types in a specific order.
#
# '-a' twiddles all possible LEDs at the same time
# '-r' reverses the default order
#
# For instance, run the script in 2 VMs at once, one with '-r'.
#
# LEDs are not expected to track perfectly, as other OS activities
# will light them (and buffer cache effects can delay things).  Just
# make sure that all the tested ones (hard disk, optical, USB storage,
# floppy, shared folders, net) are working.  Expected activity:
#
#     - Disk & optical devices show solid 'read'
#     - Virtual USB disk & optical devices show 'write' on the USB LED
#     - Floppy devices and shared folders alternate 'read/write'
#     - Net blinks 'write'
#
# Pre-VM setup:
#
#     Download or locate a bootable Linux ISO able to be used 'live'.
#     Make a tarball of this script + extra junk:
#
#         $ dd if=/dev/zero of=junk bs=100k count=1
#         $ tar cf floppy.img led-lights.sh junk
#
#     NOTE: floppy.img must be >= 20KiB or you will get I/O errors!
#
# VM setup:
#
#     New VM; type: Linux (subtype to match ISO); create default HD.
#     VM Settings:
#         System > raise base memory to 4GiB
#         Storage > insert 'Live bootable' Linux ISO image;
#                   turn on 'Live CD/DVD'
#         Storage > add floppy controller (i82078); insert floppy.img
#         Storage > add USB controller; insert USB HD & USB CD
#         System > move Optical before Floppy in boot order
#         Shared Folders > set up one or more Shared Folders if desired
#                   (they should be permanent, auto-mount,
#                    writable, with at least 10MB free space)
#
# Boot the VM.  Open a shell, become root, optionally install
# VirtualBox Guest Utilities to access Shared Folders, then extract
# and run this script:
#
#     $ sudo bash
#     # yum install virtualbox-guest-utils   # for Shared Folders
#     # tar xf /dev/fd0 led-lights.sh
#     # ./led-lights.sh                      [-a | -r]
