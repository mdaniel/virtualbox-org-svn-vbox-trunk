# Versions of (open)SUSE which ship X.Org Server 1.5 still do not enable
# mouse autodetection, so on these systems we have to enable vboxmouse in the
# X.Org configuration file as well as vboxvideo.  When uninstalling, we enable
# the fbdev driver, which SUSE prefers over vesa, and we leave the references
# to vboxmouse in place, as without the driver they are harmless.
