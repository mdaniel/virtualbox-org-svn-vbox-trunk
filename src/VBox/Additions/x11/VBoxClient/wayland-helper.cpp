/**
 * Interaction between VBoxClient and Wayland environment implies
 * a sequential data exchange between both parties. In order to
 * temporary store and protect this data, we put it into a Session.

 * Session can be started, joined or ended.

 * Each time when either host (via VBoxClient) or Wayland client
 * initiates a new data transfer (such as clipboard sharing or drag-n-drop
 * operation) a new session should be started. Due to current 
 * implementation,
 * no more than one session can run in the same time. Therefore, before
 * starting new session, previous one needs to be ended.

 * When either VBoxClient or Wayland thread needs to access session data,
 * it need to join session at first. Multiple threads can join the same 
 * session in parallel.

 * When sequence of operations which were required to transfer data to 
 * either side is complete, session should be ended.
 *
 * Session has the following attributes:
 *
 * STATE            - synchronization point which is used in order to prevent
 *                    access to session data when it is not allowed (see session
 *                    states description).
 * TYPE             - unique attribute which should be used for sanity checks
 *                    when accessing session data.
 * DESCRIPTION      - a text attribute which is mostly used for logging purposes
 *                    when monitoring multiple sequential sessions flow.
 * REFERENCE COUNT  - attribute which shows a number of session users who currently
 *                    joined a session.
 *
 * Session state represents synchronization point when session data needs to
 * be accessed. It can have permanent or intermediate value. The following states
 * are defined: IDLE, STARTING, STARTED and TERMINATING.
 *
 * Default state is IDLE. It is set when session is just initialized or when
 * it is ended.
 *
 * When user starts a new session, its state will be atomically switched from
 * IDLE to STARTING. Then, initialization callback, provided by user, will be invoked.
 * And, finally, state will be atomically transitioned from STARTING to STARTED.
 * Intermediate state STARTING will ensure that no other user will be allowed to
 * start, join or end session during this initialization step.
 *
 * User is only allowed to join session when it is in STARTED state. Once
 * session is joined, its reference counted will be increased by 1, provided
 * user callback will be called and, finally, reference counter will be dropped by 1.
 *
 * When user ends session, at first, its state will be atomically transitioned
 * from STARTED to TERMINATING ensuring that no other user can start, join or end
 * session in the same time. Then session will wait until all the users who joined
 * the session are left by looking into session's reference counter. After this, it
 * will invoke provided by user termination callback and atomically transition its state
 * from TERMINATING to IDLE, allowing to start a new session.
