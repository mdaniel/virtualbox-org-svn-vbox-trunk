# Component description file for CirrusLogic5430 module
#
# Cirrus Logic 5430 Controller Driver.This driver is a sample implementation
#  of the UGA Draw Protocol for the Cirrus Logic 5430 family of PCI video controllers.
#  This driver is only usable in the EFI pre-boot environment. This sample is
#  intended to show how the UGA Draw Protocol is able to function. The UGA I/O
#  Protocol is not implemented in this sample. A fully compliant EFI UGA driver
#  requires both the UGA Draw and the UGA I/O Protocol. Please refer to Microsoft's
#  documentation on UGA for details on how to write a UGA driver that is able
#  to function both in the EFI pre-boot environment and from the OS runtime.
