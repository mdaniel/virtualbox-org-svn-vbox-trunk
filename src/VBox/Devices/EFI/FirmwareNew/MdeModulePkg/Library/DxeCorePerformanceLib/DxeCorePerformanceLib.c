/** @file
  Performance library instance mainly used by DxeCore.

  This library provides the performance measurement interfaces and initializes performance
  logging for DXE phase. It first initializes its private global data structure for
  performance logging and saves the performance GUIDed HOB passed from PEI phase.
  It initializes DXE phase performance logging by publishing the Performance and PerformanceEx Protocol,
  which are consumed by DxePerformanceLib to logging performance data in DXE phase.

  This library is mainly used by DxeCore to start performance logging to ensure that
  Performance Protocol is installed at the very beginning of DXE phase.
