## @file
#  Performance library instance mainly for DxeCore usage.
#
#  This library provides the performance measurement interfaces and initializes performance
#  logging for DXE phase. It first initializes its private global data structure for
#  performance logging and saves the performance GUIDed HOB passed from PEI phase.
#  It initializes DXE phase performance logging by publishing the Performance and PerformanceEx Protocol,
#  which is consumed by DxePerformanceLib to logging performance data in DXE phase.
#  This library is mainly used by DxeCore to start performance logging to ensure that
#  Performance and PerformanceEx Protocol are installed at the very beginning of DXE phase.
