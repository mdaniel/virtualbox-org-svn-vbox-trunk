/**
  Adds a record at the end of the performance measurement log
  that records the start time of a performance measurement.

  Adds a record to the end of the performance measurement log
  that contains the Handle, Token, Module and Identifier.
  The end time of the new record must be set to zero.
  If TimeStamp is not zero, then TimeStamp is used to fill in the start time in the record.
  If TimeStamp is zero, the start time in the record is filled in with the value
  read from the current time stamp.

  @param  Handle                  Pointer to environment specific context used
                                  to identify the component being measured.
  @param  Token                   Pointer to a Null-terminated ASCII string
                                  that identifies the component being measured.
  @param  Module                  Pointer to a Null-terminated ASCII string
                                  that identifies the module being measured.
  @param  TimeStamp               64-bit time stamp.
  @param  Identifier              32-bit identifier. If the value is 0, the created record
                                  is same as the one created by StartGauge of PERFORMANCE_PROTOCOL.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The data was read correctly from the device.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES    There are not enough resources to record the measurement.
