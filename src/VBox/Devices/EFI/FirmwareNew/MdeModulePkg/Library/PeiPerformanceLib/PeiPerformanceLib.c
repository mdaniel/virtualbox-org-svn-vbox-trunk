  Performance library instance used in PEI phase.

  This file implements all APIs in Performance Library class in MdePkg. It creates
  performance logging GUIDed HOB on the first performance logging and then logs the
  performance data to the GUIDed HOB. Due to the limitation of temporary RAM, the maximum
  number of performance logging entry is specified by PcdMaxPeiPerformanceLogEntries.
