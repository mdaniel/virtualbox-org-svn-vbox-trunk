## @file
#  Performance library instance used by SMM Core.
#
#  This library provides the performance measurement interfaces and initializes performance
#  logging for the SMM phase.
#  It initializes SMM phase performance logging by publishing the SMM Performance and PerformanceEx Protocol,
#  which is consumed by SmmPerformanceLib to logging performance data in SMM phase.
#  This library is mainly used by SMM Core to start performance logging to ensure that
#  SMM Performance and PerformanceEx Protocol are installed at the very beginning of SMM phase.
