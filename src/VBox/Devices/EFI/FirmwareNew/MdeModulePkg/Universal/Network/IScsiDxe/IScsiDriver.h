  @param[in]  ControllerHandle     The handle of the controller to test. This handle

                                   an I/O abstraction to the driver.
  @param[in]  RemainingDevicePath  A pointer to the remaining portion of a device path.
                                   This parameter is ignored by device drivers, and is optional for bus drivers.


  @retval EFI_SUCCESS              The device specified by ControllerHandle and
                                   RemainingDevicePath is supported by the driver specified by This.

                                   driver or an application that requires exclusive acces.

                                   RemainingDevicePath is not supported by the driver specified by This.

  2. The first NumberOfChildren handles of ChildHandleBuffer must all be a valid
     EFI_HANDLE. In addition, all of these handles must have been created in this driver's
