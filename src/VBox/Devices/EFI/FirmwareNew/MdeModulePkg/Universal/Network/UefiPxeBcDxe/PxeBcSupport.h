  This function initialize(or configure) the Udp4Write instance.

  @param  Udp4       Pointer to the EFI_UDP4_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  StationIp  Pointer to the station ip address.
  @param  SubnetMask Pointer to the subnetmask of the station ip address.
  @param  Gateway    Pointer to the gateway ip address.
  @param  SrcPort    Pointer to the srouce port of the station.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The configuration settings were set, changed, or reset successfully.
  @retval EFI_NO_MAPPING        When using a default address, configuration (DHCP, BOOTP,
                                RARP, etc.) is not finished yet.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One or more following conditions are TRUE:
  @retval EFI_ALREADY_STARTED   The EFI UDPv4 Protocol instance is already started/configured
                                and must be stopped/reset before it can be reconfigured.
  @retval EFI_ACCESS_DENIED     UdpConfigData. AllowDuplicatePort is FALSE
                                and UdpConfigData.StationPort is already used by
                                other instance.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The EFI UDPv4 Protocol driver cannot allocate memory for this
                                EFI UDPv4 Protocol instance.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      An unexpected network or system error occurred and this instance
                                was not opened.
  @retval Others                Please examine the function Udp4->Routes(Udp4, FALSE, &mZeroIp4Addr, &mZeroIp4Addr, Gateway) returns.
