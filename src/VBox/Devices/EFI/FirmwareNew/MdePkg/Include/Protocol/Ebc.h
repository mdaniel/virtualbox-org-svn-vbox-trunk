/**
  Creates a thunk for an EBC entry point, returning the address of the thunk.

  A PE32+ EBC image, like any other PE32+ image, contains an optional header that specifies the
  entry point for image execution. However, for EBC images, this is the entry point of EBC
  instructions, so is not directly executable by the native processor. Therefore, when an EBC image is
  loaded, the loader must call this service to get a pointer to native code (thunk) that can be executed,
  which will invoke the interpreter to begin execution at the original EBC entry point.

  @param  This          A pointer to the EFI_EBC_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  ImageHandle   Handle of image for which the thunk is being created.
  @param  EbcEntryPoint Address of the actual EBC entry point or protocol service the thunk should call.
  @param  Thunk         Returned pointer to a thunk created.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The function completed successfully.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  Image entry point is not 2-byte aligned.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES   Memory could not be allocated for the thunk.
