  Provides the basic memory and I/O interfaces used toabstract accesses to devices.

  The I/O operations are carried out exactly as requested.  The caller is
  responsible for any alignment and I/O width issues that the bus, device,
  platform, or type of I/O might require.

  @param[in]      This     The EFI_SMM_CPU_IO2_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]      Width    Signifies the width of the I/O operations.
  @param[in]      Address  The base address of the I/O operations.  The caller is
                           responsible for aligning the Address if required.
  @param[in]      Count    The number of I/O operations to perform.
  @param[in,out]  Buffer   For read operations, the destination buffer to store
                           the results.  For write operations, the source buffer
                           from which to write data.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The data was read from or written to the device.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED        The Address is not valid for this system.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  Width or Count, or both, were invalid.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES   The request could not be completed due to a lack
                                 of resources.
