  SMM General Purpose Input (GPI) Dispatch2 Protocol as defined in PI 1.1 Specification
  Volume 4 System Management Mode Core Interface.

  This protocol provides the parent dispatch service for the General Purpose Input
  (GPI) SMI source generator.

  The EFI_SMM_GPI_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL provides the ability to install child handlers for the
  given event types.  Several inputs can be enabled.  This purpose of this interface is to generate an
  SMI in response to any of these inputs having a true value provided.

/**
  Registers a child SMI source dispatch function with a parent SMM driver.

  This service registers a function (DispatchFunction) which will be called when an SMI is
  generated because of one or more of the GPIs specified by RegisterContext. On return,
  DispatchHandle contains a unique handle which may be used later to unregister the function
  using UnRegister().
  The DispatchFunction will be called with Context set to the same value as was passed into
  this function in RegisterContext and with CommBuffer pointing to another instance of
  EFI_SMM_GPI_REGISTER_CONTEXT describing the GPIs which actually caused the SMI and
  CommBufferSize pointing to the size of the structure.

  @param[in]  This               Pointer to the EFI_SMM_GPI_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  DispatchFunction   Function to register for handler when the specified GPI causes an SMI.
  @param[in]  RegisterContext    Pointer to the dispatch function's context.
                                 The caller fills this context in before calling
                                 the register function to indicate to the register
                                 function the GPI(s) for which the dispatch function
                                 should be invoked.
  @param[out] DispatchHandle     Handle generated by the dispatcher to track the
                                 function instance.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The dispatch function has been successfully
                                 registered and the SMI source has been enabled.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR       The driver was unable to enable the SMI source.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  RegisterContext is invalid. The GPI input value
                                 is not within valid range.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES   There is not enough memory (system or SMM) to manage this child.
