/**
  Provides the parent dispatch service for a given Sx source generator.

  This service registers a function (DispatchFunction) which will be called when the sleep state
  event specified by RegisterContext is detected. On return, DispatchHandle contains a
  unique handle which may be used later to unregister the function using UnRegister().
  The DispatchFunction will be called with Context set to the same value as was passed into
  this function in RegisterContext and with CommBuffer and CommBufferSize set to
  NULL and 0 respectively.

  @param[in] This                Pointer to the EFI_SMM_SX_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in] DispatchFunction    Function to register for handler when the specified sleep state event occurs.
  @param[in] RegisterContext     Pointer to the dispatch function's context.
                                 The caller fills this context in before calling
                                 the register function to indicate to the register
                                 function which Sx state type and phase the caller
                                 wishes to be called back on. For this intertace,
                                 the Sx driver will call the registered handlers for
                                 all Sx type and phases, so the Sx state handler(s)
                                 must check the Type and Phase field of the Dispatch
                                 context and act accordingly.
  @param[out]  DispatchHandle    Handle of dispatch function, for when interfacing
                                 with the parent Sx state SMM driver.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The dispatch function has been successfully
                                 registered and the SMI source has been enabled.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED        The Sx driver or hardware does not support that
                                 Sx Type/Phase.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR       The Sx driver was unable to enable the SMI source.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  RegisterContext is invalid. Type & Phase are not
                                 within valid range.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES   There is not enough memory (system or SMM) to manage this
                                 child.
