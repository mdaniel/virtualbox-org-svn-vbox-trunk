/**
  Provides the parent dispatch service for the USB SMI source generator.

  This service registers a function (DispatchFunction) which will be called when the USB-
  related SMI specified by RegisterContext has occurred. On return, DispatchHandle
  contains a unique handle which may be used later to unregister the function using UnRegister().
  The DispatchFunction will be called with Context set to the same value as was passed into
  this function in RegisterContext and with CommBuffer containing NULL and
  CommBufferSize containing zero.

  @param[in]  This               Pointer to the EFI_SMM_USB_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  DispatchFunction   Function to register for handler when a USB-related SMI occurs.
  @param[in]  RegisterContext    Pointer to the dispatch function's context.
                                 The caller fills this context in before calling
                                 the register function to indicate to the register
                                 function the USB SMI types for which the dispatch
                                 function should be invoked.
  @param[out] DispatchHandle     Handle generated by the dispatcher to track the function instance.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The dispatch function has been successfully
                                 registered and the SMI source has been enabled.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR       The driver was unable to enable the SMI source.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  RegisterContext is invalid. The USB SMI type
                                 is not within valid range.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES   There is not enough memory (system or SMM) to manage this child.
