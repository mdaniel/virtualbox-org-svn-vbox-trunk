/**
  Performs an atomic decrement of an 32-bit unsigned integer.

  Performs an atomic decrement of the 32-bit unsigned integer specified by
  Value and returns the decrement value. The decrement operation must be
  performed using MP safe mechanisms. The state of the return value is not
  guaranteed to be MP safe.

  @param  Value A pointer to the 32-bit value to decrement.

  @return The decrement value.
