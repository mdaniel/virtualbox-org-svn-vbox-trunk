/**
  Reads a range of PCI configuration registers into a caller supplied buffer.

  Reads the range of PCI configuration registers specified by StartAddress and
  Size into the buffer specified by Buffer. This function only allows the PCI
  configuration registers from a single PCI function to be read. Size is
  returned. When possible 32-bit PCI configuration read cycles are used to read
  from StartAdress to StartAddress + Size. Due to alignment restrictions, 8-bit
  and 16-bit PCI configuration read cycles may be used at the beginning and the
  end of the range.

  If StartAddress > 0x0FFFFFFF, then ASSERT().
  If ((StartAddress & 0xFFF) + Size) > 0x1000, then ASSERT().
  If Size > 0 and Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().

  @param  StartAddress  Starting address that encodes the PCI Bus, Device,
                        Function and Register.
  @param  Size          Size in bytes of the transfer.
  @param  Buffer        Pointer to a buffer receiving the data read.
