   These are the notifications from the PCI bus driver that it is about to enter a certain
   phase of the PCI enumeration process.

   This member function can be used to notify the host bridge driver to perform specific actions,
   including any chipset-specific initialization, so that the chipset is ready to enter the next phase.
   Eight notification points are defined at this time. See belows:
   EfiPciHostBridgeBeginEnumeration       Resets the host bridge PCI apertures and internal data
                                          structures. The PCI enumerator should issue this notification
                                          before starting a fresh enumeration process. Enumeration cannot
                                          be restarted after sending any other notification such as
                                          EfiPciHostBridgeBeginBusAllocation.
   EfiPciHostBridgeBeginBusAllocation     The bus allocation phase is about to begin. No specific action is
                                          required here. This notification can be used to perform any
                                          chipset-specific programming.
   EfiPciHostBridgeEndBusAllocation       The bus allocation and bus programming phase is complete. No
                                          specific action is required here. This notification can be used to
                                          perform any chipset-specific programming.
   EfiPciHostBridgeBeginResourceAllocation
                                          The resource allocation phase is about to begin. No specific
                                          action is required here. This notification can be used to perform
                                          any chipset-specific programming.
   EfiPciHostBridgeAllocateResources      Allocates resources per previously submitted requests for all the PCI
                                          root bridges. These resource settings are returned on the next call to
                                          GetProposedResources(). Before calling NotifyPhase() with a Phase of
                                          EfiPciHostBridgeAllocateResource, the PCI bus enumerator is responsible
                                          for gathering I/O and memory requests for
                                          all the PCI root bridges and submitting these requests using
                                          SubmitResources(). This function pads the resource amount
                                          to suit the root bridge hardware, takes care of dependencies between
                                          the PCI root bridges, and calls the Global Coherency Domain (GCD)
                                          with the allocation request. In the case of padding, the allocated range
                                          could be bigger than what was requested.
   EfiPciHostBridgeSetResources           Programs the host bridge hardware to decode previously allocated
                                          resources (proposed resources) for all the PCI root bridges. After the
                                          hardware is programmed, reassigning resources will not be supported.
                                          The bus settings are not affected.
   EfiPciHostBridgeFreeResources          Deallocates resources that were previously allocated for all the PCI
                                          root bridges and resets the I/O and memory apertures to their initial
                                          state. The bus settings are not affected. If the request to allocate
                                          resources fails, the PCI enumerator can use this notification to
                                          deallocate previous resources, adjust the requests, and retry
                                          allocation.
   EfiPciHostBridgeEndResourceAllocation  The resource allocation phase is completed. No specific action is
                                          required here. This notification can be used to perform any chipsetspecific
                                          programming.

   This function is called multiple times to retrieve the device handles of all the PCI root bridges that

   root bridges. On each call, the handle that was returned by the previous call is passed into the

   caller can use the handle to obtain the instance of the EFI_PCI_ROOT_BRIDGE_IO_PROTOCOL

   EFI_NOT_FOUND. A PCI enumerator must enumerate the PCI root bridges in the order that they

/**
   Returns the allocation attributes of a PCI root bridge.

   The function returns the allocation attributes of a specific PCI root bridge. The attributes can vary
   from one PCI root bridge to another. These attributes are different from the decode-related
   attributes that are returned by the EFI_PCI_ROOT_BRIDGE_IO_PROTOCOL.GetAttributes() member function. The
   RootBridgeHandle parameter is used to specify the instance of the PCI root bridge. The device
   handles of all the root bridges that are associated with this host bridge must be obtained by calling
   GetNextRootBridge(). The attributes are static in the sense that they do not change during or
   after the enumeration process. The hardware may provide mechanisms to change the attributes on
   the fly, but such changes must be completed before EFI_PCI_HOST_BRIDGE_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_PROTOCOL is
   installed. The permitted values of EFI_PCI_HOST_BRIDGE_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_ATTRIBUTES are defined in
   "Related Definitions" below. The caller uses these attributes to combine multiple resource requests.
   For example, if the flag EFI_PCI_HOST_BRIDGE_COMBINE_MEM_PMEM is set, the PCI bus enumerator needs to
   include requests for the prefetchable memory in the nonprefetchable memory pool and not request any
   prefetchable memory.

                                                windows for nonprefetchable and prefetchable memory. A PCI bus
                                                driver needs to include requests for prefetchable memory in the

   EFI_PCI_HOST_BRIDGE_MEM64_DECODE             If this bit is set, then the PCI root bridge supports 64-bit memory
                                                windows. If this bit is not set, the PCI bus driver needs to include
                                                requests for a 64-bit memory address in the corresponding 32-bit
