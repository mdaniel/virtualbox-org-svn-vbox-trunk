#  Base Timer Library which uses the Time Stamp Counter in the processor.
#
#  Note: There will be 1ms penalty to get TSC frequency every time
#    by waiting for 3579 clocks of the ACPI timer, or 1ms.
#
#  Note: This library is a sample implementation that depends on chipset ACPI timer.
#    It may not work on new generation chipset. PcAtChipsetPkg AcpiTimerLib is
#    the generic timer library that can replace this one.
#
#  A version of the Timer Library using the processor's TSC.
#  The time stamp counter in newer processors may support an enhancement, referred to as invariant TSC.
#  The invariant TSC runs at a constant rate in all ACPI P-, C-. and T-states.
#  This is the architectural behavior moving forward.
#  TSC reads are much more efficient and do not incur the overhead associated with a ring transition or
#  access to a platform resource.
