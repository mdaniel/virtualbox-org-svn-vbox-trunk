To make a contribution to a TianoCore project, follow these steps.
1. Create a change description in the format specified below to
   use in the source control commit log.
2. Your commit message must include your "Signed-off-by" signature,
   and "Contributed-under" message.
3. Your "Contributed-under" message explicitly states that the
   contribution is made under the terms of the specified
   contribution agreement.  Your "Contributed-under" message
   must include the name of contribution agreement and version.
   For example: Contributed-under: TianoCore Contribution Agreement 1.0
   The "TianoCore Contribution Agreement" is included below in
   this document.
4. Submit your code to the TianoCore project using the process
   that the project documents on its web page.  If the process is
   not documented, then submit the code on development email list
   for the project.
5. It is preferred that contributions are submitted using the same
   copyright license as the base project. When that is not possible,
   then contributions using the following licenses can be accepted:
   * BSD (2-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause
   * BSD (3-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause
   * MIT: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

   Contributions of code put into the public domain can also be
