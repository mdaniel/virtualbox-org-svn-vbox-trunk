# In *inux environment, the build tools's source is required and need to be compiled
# firstly, please reference https://edk2.tianocore.org/unix-getting-started.html to
# to get how to setup build tool.
#
# After build tool is downloaded and compiled, a soft symbol linker need to be created
# at <workspace>/Conf. For example: ln -s /work/BaseTools /work/edk2/Conf/BaseToolsSource.

# Setup the environment for unix-like systems running a bash-like shell.
# This file must be "sourced" not merely executed. For example: ". edksetup.sh"
#
# CYGWIN users: Your path and filename related environment variables should be
# set up in the unix style.  This script will make the necessary conversions to
# windows style.
