/** @page pg_drv_scsi   Simple SCSI interface for BIOS access.
 *
 * This is a simple interface to access SCSI devices from the BIOS which is
 * shared between the BusLogic and the LsiLogic SCSI host adapters to simplify
 * the BIOS part.
 *
 * The first interface (if available) will be starting at port 0x430 and
 * each will occupy 4 ports. The ports are used as described below:
 *
 * +--------+--------+----------+
 * | Offset | Access | Purpose  |
 * +--------+--------+----------+
 * |   0    |  Write | Command  |
 * +--------+--------+----------+
 * |   0    |  Read  | Status   |
 * +--------+--------+----------+
 * |   1    |  Write | Data in  |
 * +--------+--------+----------+
 * |   1    |  Read  | Data out |
 * +--------+--------+----------+
 * |   2    |  R/W   | Detect   |
 * +--------+--------+----------+
 * |   3    |  Read  | SCSI rc  |
 * +--------+--------+----------+
 * |   3    |  Write | Reset    |
 * +--------+--------+----------+
 *
 * The register at port 0 receives the SCSI CDB issued from the driver when
 * writing to it but before writing the actual CDB the first write gives the
 * size of the CDB in bytes.
 *
 * Reading the port at offset 0 gives status information about the adapter. If
 * the busy bit is set the adapter is processing a previous issued request if it is
 * cleared the command finished and the adapter can process another request.
 * The driver has to poll this bit because the adapter will not assert an IRQ
 * for simplicity reasons.
 *
 * The register at offset 2 is to detect if a host adapter is available. If the
 * driver writes a value to this port and gets the same value after reading it
 * again the adapter is available.
 *
 * Any write to the register at offset 3 causes the interface to be reset. A
 * read returns the SCSI status code of the last operation.
 *
 * This part has no R0 or RC components.
