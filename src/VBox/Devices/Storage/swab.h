 * VBox storage devices:
 * C++-safe replacements for some Linux byte order macros
 *
 * On Linux, DrvHostDVD.cpp includes <linux/cdrom.h>, which in turn
 * includes <linux/byteorder/swab.h>.  Unfortunately, that file is not very
 * C++ friendly, and our C++ compiler refuses to look at it.  The solution
 * is to define _LINUX_BYTEORDER_SWAB_H, which prevents that file's contents
 * from getting included at all, and to provide, in this file, our own
 * C++-proof versions of the macros which are needed by <linux/cdrom.h>
 * before we include that file.  We actually provide them as inline
 * functions, due to the way they get resolved in the original.
