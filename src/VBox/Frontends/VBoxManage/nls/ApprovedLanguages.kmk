# The list of approved VBoxManage language codes for built-in docbook
# help. Order matters for codes in the case of a language used in
# multiple countries. The language code used when no country is
# specified should be placed before other codes with the same language.
# For example: if en_US, en_UK and en_AU are approved the en_US should
# be placed before others allowing en_US to be used when the user
# specifies "en" as the desired language.
