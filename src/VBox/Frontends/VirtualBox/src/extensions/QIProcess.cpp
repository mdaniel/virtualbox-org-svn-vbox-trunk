    // Why is it really needed is because of Qt4.3 bug with QProcess.
    // This bug is about QProcess sometimes (~70%) do not receive
    // notification about process was finished, so this makes
    // 'bool QProcess::waitForFinished (int)' block the GUI thread and
    // never dismissed with 'true' result even if process was really
    // started&finished. So we just waiting for some information
    // on process output and destroy the process with force. Due to
    // QProcess::~QProcess() has the same 'waitForFinished (int)' blocker
    // we have to change process state to QProcess::NotRunning.

    /// @todo Do we still need this?
