  * left control event and a right alt one.  Since the left control event does
  * not correspond to actually pressing or releasing the left control key we
  * would like to detect it and handle it.  This class monitors all key down and
  * up events and if it detects that a left control down event has been sendt
  * although left control should be up it tells us to insert a left control up
  * event into the event stream.  While this does not let us filter out the
  * unwanted event at source, it should still make guest system keyboard handling
  * work correctly. */
