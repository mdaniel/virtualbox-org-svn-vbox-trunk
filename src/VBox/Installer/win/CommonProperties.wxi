  <!-- MSI is soo messed up wrt NT versioning on Windows 10.  msiexec runs in
       Windows 8.1 compatibility mode, so everything returns 6.3 as the
       version.  This unfortunately include all system DLLs.  Fortunately,
       the build number is left as-is, so we ASSUME build numbers above 10000
       means its Windows 10.
       Note! "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\CurrentBuild" could
             probably be read here as well (CurrentVersion is "6.3" of course). -->
