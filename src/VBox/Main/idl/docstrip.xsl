    Copies the source XIDL file to the output, except that all <desc>
    tags are stripped in the process. This is to generate a copy
    of VirtualBox.xidl which is then used as a source for generating
    the COM/XPCOM headers, the webservice files, the Qt bindings and
    others. The idea is that updating the documentation tags in the
    original XIDL should not cause a full recompile of nearly all of
    VirtualBox.
