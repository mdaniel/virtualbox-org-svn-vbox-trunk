/**
 * Smart class that automatically increases the number of normal (non-limited)
 * callers of the given VirtualBoxBase object when an instance is constructed
 * and decreases it back when the created instance goes out of scope (i.e. gets
 * destroyed).
 *
 * If #rc() returns a failure after the instance creation, it means that
 * the managed VirtualBoxBase object is not Ready, or in any other invalid
 * state, so that the caller must not use the object and can return this
 * failed result code to the upper level.
 *
 * See ObjectState::addCaller() and ObjectState::releaseCaller() for more
 * details about object callers.
 *
 * A typical usage pattern to declare a normal method of some object (i.e. a
 * method that is valid only when the object provides its full
 * functionality) is:
 * <code>
 * STDMETHODIMP Component::Foo()
 * {
 *     AutoCaller autoCaller(this);

 *     if (SUCCEEDED(hrc))

 * Smart class to enclose the state transition NotReady->InInit->Ready.

 * The purpose of this span is to protect object initialization.

 * as the argument at the beginning of init() methods of VirtualBoxBase
 * subclasses. When this variable is created it automatically places the
 * object to the InInit state.
 *
 * When the created variable goes out of scope (i.e. gets destroyed) then,

 * places the object to Ready or Limited state or calls the object's
 * VirtualBoxBase::uninit() method which is supposed to place the object
 * back to the NotReady state using the AutoUninitSpan class.
 *
 * The initial result status of the initialization span is determined by the
 * @a aResult argument of the AutoInitSpan constructor (Result::Failed by
 * default). Inside the initialization span, the success status can be set
 * to Result::Succeeded using #setSucceeded(), to to Result::Limited using
 * #setLimited() or to Result::Failed using #setFailed(). Please don't
 * forget to set the correct success status before getting the AutoInitSpan
 * variable destroyed (for example, by performing an early return from
 * the init() method)!
 *
 * Note that if an instance of this class gets constructed when the object
 * is in the state other than NotReady, #isOk() returns |false| and methods
 * of this class do nothing: the state transition is not performed.
