    /**
     *  Helper class that safely manages the machine state dependency by
     *  calling Machine::addStateDependency() on construction and
     *  Machine::releaseStateDependency() on destruction. Intended for Machine
     *  children. The usage pattern is:
     *
     *  @code
     *      AutoCaller autoCaller(this);
     *      if (FAILED(autoCaller.hrc())) return autoCaller.hrc();
     *
     *      Machine::AutoStateDependency<MutableStateDep> adep(mParent);
     *      if (FAILED(stateDep.hrc())) return stateDep.hrc();
     *      ...
     *      // code that depends on the particular machine state
     *      ...
     *  @endcode
     *
     *  Note that it is more convenient to use the following individual
     *  shortcut classes instead of using this template directly:
     *  AutoAnyStateDependency, AutoMutableStateDependency,
     *  AutoMutableOrSavedStateDependency, AutoMutableOrRunningStateDependency
     *  or AutoMutableOrSavedOrRunningStateDependency. The usage pattern is
     *  exactly the same as above except that there is no need to specify the
     *  template argument because it is already done by the shortcut class.
     *
     *  @param taDepType    Dependency type to manage.
