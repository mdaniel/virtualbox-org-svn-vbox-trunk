/**
 * Implements a "flat" objects list with a lock. Since each such list
 * has its own lock it is not a good idea to implement trees with this.
 *
 * ObjectList<T> is designed to behave as if it were a std::list of
 * COM pointers of class T; in other words,
 * ObjectList<Medium> behaves like std::list< ComObjPtr<Medium> > but
 * it's less typing. Iterators, front(), size(), begin() and end()
 * are implemented.
 *
 * In addition it automatically includes an RWLockHandle which can be
 * accessed with getLockHandle().
 *
 * If you need the raw std::list for some reason you can access it with
 * getList().
 *
 * The destructor automatically calls uninit() on every contained
 * COM object. If this is not desired, clear the member list before
 * deleting the list object.
