==========================================
rdesktop: A Remote Desktop Protocol client
==========================================

rdesktop is an open source client for Microsoft's RDP protocol. It is
known to work with Windows versions such as NT 4 Terminal Server,
2000, XP, 2003, 2003 R2, Vista, 2008, 7, and 2008 R2. rdesktop
currently implements the RDP version 4 and 5 protocols.

Installation
------------
rdesktop uses a GNU-style build procedure.  Typically all that is necessary
to install rdesktop is the following::

	% ./configure
	% make
	% make install

The default is to install under /usr/local.  This can be changed by adding
--prefix=directory to the configure line.

Note for Subversion users
-------------------------
If you have downloaded a snapshot of rdesktop using Subversion, you
will first need to run ./bootstrap in order to generate the build
infrastructure.  This is not necessary for release versions of
rdesktop.

Invocation
----------
Simply run::

	% rdesktop server

where server is the name of the Terminal Services machine.  (If you receive
"Connection refused", this probably means that the server does not have
Terminal Services enabled, or there is a firewall blocking access.)

You can also specify a number of options on the command line.  These are listed
in the rdesktop manual page (run "man rdesktop").

Smart-card support notes
------------------------
The smart-card support module uses PCSC-lite. You should use PCSC-lite 1.2.9 or
later.

To enable smart-card support in the rdesktop just run "./configure" with the
"--enable-smartcard" option. Also you can enable smart-card debug with
additional "--with-debug-smartcard" option.
