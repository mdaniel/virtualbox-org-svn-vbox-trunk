* General

  * Rework main loop to a generic event handler (i.e. move select() to
    the top of the stack, not the end). Also means rewriting the connect
    procedure as a state machine.

  * Stop using static objects for packets and make it more clear when it
    is in use (explicit allocation and free).

* Clipboard:

  * Support other data types than plain text. 
 
  * Conversion between different character sets. 


* Drive Redirection:

  * Real support for file locking

  * Handle reconnections correctly. 

  * Various deficiencies; see FIXMEs in source code. 


* Serial Port Redirection:

  * More testing needed. 


* Printer Redirection:

  * More testing needed. 


* Keymapping: 


* Sound redirection

  * Use timestamps in audio packets.

  * Add resampling to supported samplerates of audio-hardware.

  * Lower CPU-usage with an audio thread.


* Smartcard redirection

  * Merge patches currently implementing sc-redirection.


* Miscellaneous

  * Clean up header files. The current "proto.h" and "xproto.h" is far
    from optimal.

  * Go through the many trackers (bugs/patches/RFEs) at SourceForge. 

  * More fancy homepage. 

  * Enhance documentation. Write a FAQ. 


* SeamlessRDP mode

  * Add a client to server message for starting additional
    applications.

  * Support cmd.exe. 

  * Support for Input Contexts. 

  * Enhanced support for WM_DELETE_WINDOW: Instead of terminating
    rdesktop, close the window on the server side. 

  * Systray support. 

  * Better support for non-EWMH window managers. 

  * Support for non-rectangular windows. 

  * The focus handling of menus is a bit crude. 

  * Support for sending focus information from client to server.

  * Implement something similiar to explhook.dll - support for running
    explorer.exe in non-shell mode. 

  * Better compatibility with Task Manager. 

  * XINERAMA support.  

  * When enumerating windows, make sure to send info about windows
    that are transient for other windows after the referred window.

  * We support topmost windows at creating time, but we do not detect
    when this property is added or removed. This can be verified with
    task manager, which has an "Always on top" option. 

  * Window icons are not set when reconnecting. get_icon/update_icon
    needs to be called from enum_cb.
