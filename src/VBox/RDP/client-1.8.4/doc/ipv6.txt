IPv6 support in rdesktop
========================
The IPv6 support was developed by Mike Dawson <mike@dexy.mine.nu>:

    Attached is a patch to tcp.c to enable IPv6 support.  Build with
    'IPv6' defined to enable it.  It's so far only been tested on
    Linux 2.4.21 connecting to Windows XP SP1.
    
    Since terminal services doesn't seem to bind to the ipv6 interface
    on XP I had to run 'netsh interface portproxy add v6tov4
    listenport=3389 connectport=3389' from the windows command prompt
    to get it to work.
    

rdesktop now supports numeric IPv6 addresses:

    It checks for two or more colons in an address to decide what it's
    dealing with so you can now do:

    rdesktop 2001:1:2:3::4
    
    without it getting confused with an ipv4:port specification.  I've
    also followed the square bracket convention used by browsers
    (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt) so if you want to specify a
    non-standard port with an ipv6 address you can use the format:
    
    rdesktop [2001:1:2:3::4]:3390
