To be able to connect to Microsoft Windows 2000 Terminal Services (and
probably later versions), you'll need to deal with licensing. This is
complicated. This file is supposed to contain some information about
how rdesktop works with Microsofts license systems.

There's a lot of information on the MS web site, for example,
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;287687.

From the rdesktop mailing list:

> We are running rdesktop 1.2 on machine A and connects to a Windows 2000
> Server (machine B). The W2K machine has 5 real licenses installed ("Windows
> 2000 Terminal Services Client Access License", "Open" type). This can be
> verifier by using "Terminal Services Licensing". The problem is that all
> issued licenses have an expire-date. The expire date for the license issued
> to A was reached today, and no more connections could be made until we
> changed the client name (by using -n).
> 
> We also have another similiar systems, with Linux machine C and W2K server 
> D. This server has 200 licenses installed of the type "Select". On this 
> server, the issued licenses seems to be permanent: The expire date is set 
> to "-", and we have no problem with this system. 
> 
> The question of course is why the first system issues license with
> expiration date, while the second system issues permanent licenses.
