/** Very like some remnant from the 8086, 286 and 386 days of DOS, OS/2 and
 * similar, where you could link with different floating point libs.  My guess
 * would be that this constant indicates to the compiled code which floating
 * point support the library provides, probably especially as it comes to
 * printf and scanf conversion but probably also emulation/real hw.
 *
 * Found some old 16-bit and 32-bit MSC C libraries (probably around v6.0)
 * which all seems to define it as 0x9876.  They also have a whole bunch of
 * external dependencies on what seems to be mostly conversion helpers.
