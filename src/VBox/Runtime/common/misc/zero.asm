; Section to put this in.
;
;       - PE/COFF: Unless we put this in an BSS like section, the linker will
;         write out 64KB of zeros.  (Tried using .rdata$zz and put it at the end
;         of that section, but the linker did not reduce the RawDataSize.)  The
;         assmebler does not let us control the write flag directly, so we emit
;         a linker directive that switches of the write flag for the section.
;
;       - Fallback: Code section.
