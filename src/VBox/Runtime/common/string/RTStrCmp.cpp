/**
 * Performs a case sensitive string compare between two UTF-8 strings.

 * @returns < 0 if the first string less than the second string.
 * @returns 0 if the first string identical to the second string.
 * @returns > 0 if the first string greater than the second string.
 * @param   psz1        First UTF-8 string. Null is allowed.
 * @param   psz2        Second UTF-8 string. Null is allowed.
