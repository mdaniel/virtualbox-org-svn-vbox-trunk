/**
 * Destroys the specified tree, starting with the root node and working our way down.
 *
 * @returns 0 on success.
 * @returns Return value from callback on failure. On failure, the tree will be in
 *          an unbalanced condition and only further calls to the Destroy should be
 *          made on it. Note that the node we fail on will be considered dead and
 *          no action is taken to link it back into the tree.
 * @param   ppTree          Pointer to the AVL-tree root node pointer.
 * @param   pfnCallBack     Pointer to callback function.
 * @param   pvUser          User parameter passed on to the callback function.
