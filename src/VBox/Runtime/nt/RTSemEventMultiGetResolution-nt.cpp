     * In older versions of NT, these timeout were implemented using KTIMERs and
     * have the same resolution as what them.  This should be found using
     * ExSetTimerResolution or NtQueryTimerResolution.
     *
     * Probably since windows 8.1 the value returned by NtQueryTimerResolution (and
     * set NtSetTimerResolution) have been virtualized and no longer reflects the
     * timer wheel resolution, at least from what I can tell. ExSetTimerResolution
     * still works as before, but it accesses variable that I cannot find out how
     * to access from user land.  So, kernel will get (and be able to set) the right
     * granularity, while in user land we'll be forced to reporting the max value.
     *
     * (The reason why I suspect it's since 8.1 is because the high resolution
     * ExSetTimer APIs were introduced back then.)
