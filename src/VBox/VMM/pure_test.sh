# pure_test.sh - test the effect of __attribute__((pure)) on a set of
#                functions.
#
# Mark the functions with EXPERIMENT_PURE where the attribute normally would,
# go update this script so it points to the right header and execute it.  At
# the end you'll get a pt-report.txt showing the fluctuations in the text size.
