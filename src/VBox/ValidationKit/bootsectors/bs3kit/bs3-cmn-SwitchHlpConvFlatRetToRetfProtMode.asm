; SwitchToXxx helper that converts a 32-bit or 64-bit flat return address
; into a 16-bit protected mode far return.

;
; The caller calls this routine before switching modes. The flat return
; to be converted is immediately after our own return address on the stack.
;
; @uses     Nothing.
; @remarks  No 16-bit version.
