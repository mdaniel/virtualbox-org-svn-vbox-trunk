;;
; SwitchToXxx helper that converts a 16-bit real mode far return
; into something suitable for the current mode and performs the return.
;
; The caller jmps to this routine.  The stack holds an incremented BP (odd is
; far indicator) and a 16-bit far return address.
;
; @uses     Nothing.
; @remarks  16-bit ASSUMES we're returning to protected mode!!
