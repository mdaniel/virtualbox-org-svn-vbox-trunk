;;
; Rough CPU detection, mainly for detecting really old CPUs.
;
; A Bs3CpuDetectEx can be added if this is insufficient.
;
; @returns  BS3CPU_xxx in xAX.
; @cproto   BS3_DECL(BS3CPU) Bs3CpuDetect(void);
;
; @uses     xAX.
;
; @remarks  ASSUMES we're in ring-0 when not in some kind of real mode.
;
; @note     We put the real mode version of this code in the RMTEXT16 segment
;           to save space elsewhere.  We generate a far call stub that goes
;           to the right segment.
