    This is a hack to avoid the self.oVBoxMgr.constants.MachineState_Running
    ugliness that forces one into the right margin...  Anyone using this module
    can get to the constants easily by:

        from testdriver import vboxcon
        if self.o.machine.state == vboxcon.MachineState_Running:
            do stuff;

    For our own convenience there's a vboxcon attribute set up in vbox.py,
    class TestDriver which is the basis for the VirtualBox testcases. It takes
    care of setting things up properly through the global variable
    'goHackModuleClass' that refers to the instance of this class(if we didn't
    we'd have to use testdriver.vboxcon.MachineState_Running).
