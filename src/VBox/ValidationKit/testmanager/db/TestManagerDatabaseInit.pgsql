--- @table TestCaseArgs
-- Test case argument list variations.
--

-- the same stuff, but the guest OS as well as the VMM may react differently to
-- the hardware configurations and uncover issues in the VMM, device emulation
-- or other places.
--
-- Typical hardware variations are:
--      - guest memory size (RAM),
--      - guest video memory size (VRAM),
--      - virtual CPUs / cores / threads,
--      - virtual chipset
--      - virtual network interface card (NIC)
--      - USB 1.1, USB 2.0, no USB
--
-- The TM web UI will help the user create a reasonable set of permutations
-- of these parameters, the user specifies a maximum and the TM uses certain
-- rules together with random selection to generate the desired number.  The
-- UI will also help suggest fitting testbox requirements according to the
-- RAM/VRAM sizes and the virtual CPU counts.  The user may then make
-- adjustments to the suggestions before commit them.
--
-- Alternatively, the user may also enter all the permutations without any
-- help from the UI.
--
-- Note! All test cases has at least one entry in this table, even if it is
-- empty, because testbox requirements are specified thru this.
--
-- Querying the valid parameter lists for a testase this way:
--      SELECT * ... WHERE idTestCase = TestCases.idTestCase
--                     AND tsExpire     > <when>
--                     AND tsEffective <= <when>;
--
-- Querying the valid parameter list for the latest generation can be
-- simplified by just checking tsExpire date:
--      SELECT * ... WHERE idTestCase = TestCases.idTestCase
--                     AND tsExpire    == TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE 'infinity';

--- @table SchedGroups
-- Scheduling group (aka. testbox partitioning) configuration.
--
-- A testbox is associated with exactly one scheduling group.  This association
-- can be changed, of course.  If we (want to) retire a group which still has
-- testboxes associated with it, these will be moved to the 'default' group.
--
-- The TM web UI will make sure that a testbox is always in a group and that
-- the default group cannot be deleted.
--
-- A scheduling group combines several things:
--      - A selection of builds to test (via idBuildSrc).
--      - A collection of test groups to test with (via SchedGroupMembers).
--      - A set of testboxes to test on (via TestBoxes.idSchedGroup).
--
-- In additions there is an optional source of fresh test suite builds (think
-- VBoxTestSuite) as well as scheduling options.
--
-- @remarks This table stores history.  Never update or delete anything.  The
--          equivalent of deleting is done by setting the 'tsExpire' field to
--          current_timestamp.  To select the currently valid entries use

--- @table BuildBlacklist
-- Table used to blacklist sets of builds.
--
-- The best usage example is a VMM developer realizing that a change causes the
-- host to panic, hang, or otherwise misbehave.  To prevent the testbox sheriff
-- from repeatedly having to reboot testboxes, the builds gets blacklisted
-- until there is a working build again.  This may mean adding an open ended
-- blacklist spec and then updating it with the final revision number once the
-- fix has been committed.
--
-- @remarks This table stores history.  Never update or delete anything.  The
--          equivalent of deleting is done by setting the 'tsExpire' field to
--          current_timestamp.  To select the currently valid entries use
--          tsExpire = TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE 'infinity'.
--
-- @todo Would be nice if we could replace the text strings below with a set of
--       BuildCategories, or sore it in any other way which would enable us to
--       do a negative join with build category...  The way it is specified
--       now, it looks like we have to open a cursor of prospecitve builds and
--       filter then thru this table one by one.
--
--       Any better representation is welcome, but this is low prioirty for
--       now, as it's relatively easy to change this later one.

    --     other tests.  Should a gang member leave early and embark on a
    --     testcase using the same resources, bad things will happen.  Example:
    --     Live migration.  One partner leaves early because it detected some
    --     fatal failure, the other one is still trying to connect to him.
    --     The testbox is scheduled again on the same live migration testcase,
    --     only with different arguments (VM config), it will try migrate using
    --     the same TCP ports. Confusion ensues.

--- @table SchedQueues

-- thruput, making sacrifices in the hardware distribution area.  The latter is
-- more like the old buildbox style testing, making sure that each test case is
-- executed on each testbox.
--
-- When there are configuration changes, TM will regenerate the scheduling
-- queue for the affected scheduling groups.  We do not concern ourselves with
-- trying to continue at the approximately same queue position, we simply take
-- it from the top.
--
-- When a testbox ask for work, we will open a cursor on the queue and take the
-- first test in the queue that can be executed on that testbox.  The test will
-- be moved to the end of the queue (getting a new item_id).
--
-- If a test is manually changed to the head of the queue, the item will get a
-- item_id which is 1 lower than the head of the queue.  Unless someone does
-- this a couple of billion times, we shouldn't have any trouble running out of
-- number space. :-)
--
-- Manually moving a test to the end of the queue is easy, just get a new
-- 'item_id'.
