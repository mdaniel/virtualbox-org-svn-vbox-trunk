Test VM - t-dos401-win30me - DOS 4.01 /w patch and Windows 3.0 Multimedia Edition
=================================================================================

Setup:
 - Create a default DOS VM 't-dos401-win30me', but restrict the memory to 4MB.
 - Install DOS (single partition, etc).
 - Install CDROM driver (e.g. OAK).
 - Install Window 3.0 multimedia edition into C:\MWINDOWS.
     - Select tandy soundblaster driver, make sure to configure
       them correctly (port 220, irq 5, dma 5/7) or they will hang
       the system.  Check that it works.
     - Disable the tandy welcome screen.
 - Copy DosSleep.exe, DosVmOff.com, and WinExit.exe onto the disk.
 - Start the macro recorder (recorder.exe) in windows and record two different
   macro files, both which are associated with Shift-F7 and play in normal time.
   First C:\WinExit.Rec:
     - [Anything that might be useful+easy to test in read mode]
     - File->Run in the program manager using keyboard (Alt-F, R)
     - Type in "C:\WinExit.exe" and enter (no mouse).
     - Save macro.
   Second (hit File->New first) C:\TestMM.Rec:
     - File->Run in the program manager using keyboard (Alt-F, R)
     - Type in "welcome.exe" and enter (no mouse).
     - Wait for the tandy welcome animation to finish.
     - [Anything else that might be useful+easy to test]
     - File->Run in program manager again.
     - Type in "C:\WinExit.exe" and enter (no mouse).
     - Save macro.
 - Edit win.ini changing the REC file association to:
       rec=RECORDER.EXE -H +F7  ^.REC
   This allows us to load .REC with Shift-F7 macros inside them at startup and
   execute them.  (Windows 3.0 didn't have a startup folder.)
 - Make a copy of win.ini called win-mm.ini changing the 'load=scrnsvr.exe'
   statement to 'load=c:\testmm.rec'.
 - Make a copy of win.ini called win-exit.ini changing the 'load=scrnsvr.exe'
   statement to 'load=c:\winexit.rec'.
 - Create c:\test.bat with the following content:
       :dos-stuff
       echo TESTING chkdsk C: >COM1
       dossleep 1
       chkdsk c:
       if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

       echo TESTING c:\mwindows\msd.exe /f nul >COM1
       dossleep 1
       c:\mwindows\msd.exe /f nul
       if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

       :386mode
       echo TESTING win /3 >COM1
       dossleep 1
       copy c:\mwindows\win-mm.ini c:\mwindows\win.ini
       win /3
       if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

       :standardmode-max-4mb
       echo TESTING win /s >COM1
       dossleep 1
       copy c:\mwindows\win-mm.ini c:\mwindows\win.ini
       win /s
       if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

       :realmode
       echo TESTING win /r >COM1
       dossleep 1
       copy c:\mwindows\win-exit.ini c:\mwindows\win.ini
       win /r
       if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

       :success
       echo PASSED>COM1
       goto done

       :fail
       echo ERRORLEVEL=%ERRORLEVEL%
       echo FAILED>COM1

       :done
       echo powering off the vm in 5 seconds...
       dossleep 1
       dossleep 1
       dossleep 1
       dossleep 1
       dossleep 1
       dosvmoff
 - Edit c:\autoexec.bat appending "echo on" and "call c:\test.bat".
