Test VM - t-dos401-win30me - DOS 4.01 /w patch and Windows 3.0 Multimedia Edition
=================================================================================

Setup:
 - Create a default DOS VM 't-dos401-win30me', but restrict the memory to 4MB.
 - Install DOS (single partition, etc).
 - Install CDROM driver (e.g. OAK).
 - Install Window 3.0 multimedia edition into C:\MWINDOWS.
     - Select tandy soundblaster driver, make sure to configure
       them correctly (port 220, irq 5, dma 5/7) or they will hang
       the system.
     - Disable the tandy welcome screen.
 - Edit win.ini changing the REC file association to:
       rec=RECORDER.EXE -H +F7  ^.REC
   This allows us to load .REC with Shift-F7 macros inside them at startup and
   execute them.  (Windows 3.0 didn't have a startup folder.)
 - Copy DosSleep.exe, DosVmOff.com, and WinExit.exe onto the disk.
 - ... more later.
