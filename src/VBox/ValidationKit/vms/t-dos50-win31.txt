Test VM - t-dos50-win31 - DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1
=================================================

Setup:
 - Create a default DOS VM 't-dos50-win31'.
 - Install DOS (single partition, etc).
 - Install CDROM driver (e.g. OAK).
 - Install Window 3.1 into C:\WINDOWS.

   with them. Test that you can hear them.
 - Copy DosSleep.exe, DosVmOff.com, and WinExit.exe onto the disk (C:\).
 - Start the macro recorder (recorder.exe) in windows and record a macro file
   that can be run automatically, make sure to associate it with Shift-F7 and
   that it plays in normal time.
   First C:\AbtExit.rec:
     - Help->About in the program manager using keyboard (Alt-H, A).
     - Dismiss using the enter key after a beat (no mouse).
     - [Anything that might be useful+easy to test]
     - File->Run in the program manager using keyboard (Alt-F, R)
     - Type in "C:\WinExit.exe" and enter (no mouse).
     - Save macro.
 - Open the startup folder and create a program item with the following command line:
     C:\WINDOWS\RECORDER.EXE -H +F7 C:\ABTREXIT.REC
 - Create c:\test.bat with the following content:
     :dos-stuff
     echo TESTING CHKDSK C: >COM1
     dossleep 1
     C:\DOS\CHKDSK.EXE C:
     if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

     echo TESTING msd.exe /P NUL >COM1
     dossleep 1
     C:\WINDOWS\MSD.EXE /P NUL
     if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

     echo TESTING qbasic.exe /RUN C:\HELLO.BAS >COM1
     dossleep 1
     C:\DOS\QBASIC.EXE /RUN C:\HELLO.BAS
     if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

     :386mode
     echo TESTING win /3 >COM1
     dossleep 1
     win /3
     if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

     :standardmode
     echo TESTING win /s >COM1
     dossleep 1
     win /s
     if not errorlevel 0 goto fail

     :success
     echo PASSED>COM1
     goto done

     :failed
     echo FAILED>COM1
     goto done

     :done
     echo powering off the VM in 5 seconds...
     dossleep 1
     dossleep 1
     dossleep 1
     dossleep 1
     dossleep 1
     dosvmoff
 - Create C:\HELLO.BAS with the following content:
     PRINT "Hello World!"
     SYSTEM
     END
 - Edit c:\autoexec.bat appending "echo on" and "call c:\test.bat".
 - Check that C:\config.sys contains himem.sys from windows and no emm386.
