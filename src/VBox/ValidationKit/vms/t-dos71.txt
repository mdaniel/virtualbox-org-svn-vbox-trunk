Test VM - t-dos71 - PC-DOS 7.1 (or 7.0)
=======================================

Setup:
 - Create a default DOS VM 't-dos71'.
 - Install DOS (single partition, etc).  Make sure to install the IBM anti virus.
 - Make sure POWER.EXE is loaded by Config.sys and that emm386 isn't used.
 - Add /V to HIMEM.
 - Install CDROM driver (e.g. OAK).
 - Copy DosSleep.exe and DosVmOff.com onto the disk (C:\).
 - Create c:\test.bat with the following content:
     echo TESTING: chkdsk C: >COM1
     C:\DOS\CHKDSK.COM C:
     @IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 0 GOTO fail
     @
     echo TESTING: IBM anti virus scan >COM1
     c:\dos\ibmavsp.exe C: -ALL -NLOG
     @IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 0 GOTO fail
     @
     echo PASSED>COM1
     goto done

     :fail
     echo FAILED>COM1
     goto done

     :done
     @echo Powering off in 5 seconds...
     dossleep 5
     dosvmoff
 - Edit c:\autoexec.bat appending "echo on" and "call c:\test.bat".
 - Check that C:\config.sys contains himem.sys from windows and no emm386.
