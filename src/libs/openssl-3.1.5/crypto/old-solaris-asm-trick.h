 * OpenSSL - Hack for older binutils/gas on solaris (10).
 *
 * Disable the .cfi_xxxx directives for Solaris 10/amd64 with old gas, as gas will 
 * be creating .eh_frame with the wrong kind of of section type, causing the 
 * linker to stop with an fatal error.  Looks like this was addressed between
 * binutils 2.18 and 2.20.1. 
 * 
 * The .xref directive is ignored by gas v2.15, so we map the .cfi_xxxx stuff 
 * onto it.
