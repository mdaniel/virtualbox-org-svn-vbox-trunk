# Wraps #pragma once up in #ifndef RT_WITHOUT_PRAGMA_ONCE...#endif.
#
# This is for gcc 3.3.x and older which considers #pragma once as obsolete and
# warns about it unconditionally.  This results in gigantic ValKit build logs
# and makes them hard to search for actual problems.
#
# Apply to include/crypto/*.h and include/internal/*.h with the modify
# in-place option of sed (not on windows, no eol attribs!):
#     kmk_sed -f vbox-pragma-once.sed -i include/crypto/*.h include/internal/*.h
