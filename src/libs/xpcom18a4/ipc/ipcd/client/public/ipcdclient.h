 *  o  If the message target is already defined, then this function simply
 *     resets its message observer.
 *  o  If the message target is not already defined, then the message target
 *     is defined and the IPC daemon is notified of the existance of this
 *     message target.
 *  o  If null is passed for the message observer, then the message target is
 *     removed, and the daemon is notified of the removal of this message target.
 *
 * If aOnCurrentThread is true, then notifications to the observer will occur
 * on the current thread.  This means that there must be a nsIEventTarget
 * associated with the calling thread.  If aOnCurrentThread is false, then
 * notifications to the observer will occur on a background thread.  In which
 * case, the observer must be threadsafe.

/**
 * This function blocks the calling thread until a message for the given target
 * is received (optionally from the specified client).
 *
 * The aSenderID parameter is interpreted as follows:
 *  o  If aSenderID is 0, then this function waits for a message to be sent by
 *     the IPC daemon.
 *  o  If aSenderID is IPC_SENDER_ANY, then this function waits for a message
 *     to be sent from any source.
 *  o  Otherwise, this function waits for a message to be sent by the client
 *     with ID given by aSenderID.  If aSenderID does not identify a valid
 *     client, or if the client dies while waiting, then this function will
 *     return an error.
 *
 * The aObserver parameter is interpreted as follows:
 *  o  If aObserver is null, then the default message observer for the target
 *     is invoked when the next message is received.
 *  o  Otherwise, aObserver will be inovked when the next message is received.
 *
 * The aConsumer parameter is interpreted as follows:
 *  o  If aObserver is null or aConsumer is null, this parameter is ignored.
 *  o  Otherwise, aConsumer will be invoked right after (and only if) aObserver
 *     has accepted some message. It will receive exactly the same message
 *     that was accepted by aObserver.
 *
 * The aTimeout parameter is interpreted as follows:
 *  o  If aTimeout is PR_INTERVAL_NO_TIMEOUT, then this function will block
 *     until a matching message is received.
 *  o  If aTimeout is PR_INTERVAL_NO_WAIT, then this function will only inspect
 *     the current queue of messages.  If no matching message is found, then
 *     IPC_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK is returned.
 *  o  Otherwise, aTimeout specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for a
 *     matching message to be received.  If no matching message is found after
 *     the timeout expires, then IPC_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK is returned.
 *
 * If aObserver's OnMessageAvailable function returns IPC_WAIT_NEXT_MESSAGE,
 * then the function will continue blocking until the next matching message
 * is received.  Bypassed messages will be dispatched to the default message
 * observer when the event queue, associated with the thread that called
 * IPC_DefineTarget, is processed.
 *
 * There is a special case if aSenderID is IPC_SENDER_ANY and one of IPC clients
 * dies while this function waits for a message. In this case, aObserver's
 * OnMessageAvailable function is called with a special set of arguments:
 * dead client id, empty target id and null message (both data and data length
 * are zeroes). If it returns IPC_WAIT_NEXT_MESSAGE, IPC_WaitMessage continues
 * blocking as usual, otherwise an error is immediately returned to the caller.
 *
 * aObserver is not expected to use any IPC system functons from within its
 * OnMessageAvailable implementation. This is because the IPC system is not
 * re-entrant during invocation of OnMessageAvailable function, and making other
 * IPC calls can lead to unexpected results (like message losses or traps). On
 * the contrary, aConsumer's OnMessageAvailable function is allowed to use the
 * IPC system without any limitations.
 *
 * This function runs the risk of hanging the calling thread indefinitely if
 * no matching message is ever received.
