Install the dependencies needed for building VirtualBox on an deb-based Linux
system.  Additional distributions will be added as needed.  There are no plans
to add support for or to accept patches for distributions we do not package.
The \`--with-docs\' parameter is to install the packages needed for building
documentation.  It will also be implemented per distribution as needed."
